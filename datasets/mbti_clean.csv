Abrasiveness and the perceiving axes,Jason6012,1658556857,"I don‚Äôt recall where but I have heard that types on the Ni-Se axis tend to be more abrasive, which I am defining as being of relatively little concern for the feelings of others, than their Ne-Si counterparts. 

For example, an INFJ would tend to be more harsh than an ISFJ, and an ESTP would tend to be more blunt than an ENTP.

ISFP boy and INTP girl relationship,Eastern-Gas2340,1658548796,Curious about commonalities and differences in our personality types,mbti
im stuck in what is my mbti,Omgaby123,1658548525,"Ok so, i made a few online tests, the ones i most related is istp, estp and entp, i tried studying the functions too, im not sure if i even did it right but i saw myself in extp, imma throw my weak points/bad things and see if someone here can get some guesses hahahahah üò≠

1- the main bad thing about me is that im hardly empathetic, i cant help anyone when they are crying, sometimes im probably trying to spit some solution without realising it

2- im lazy and procastinator, specifically when someone gave me those orders, gosh i hate getting orders üò´

3- sometimes i have some idea to do something, but for some reason i dont actually do it, or maybe sometimes i try to do it, but give up

4- i always prefer to do things alone even though im extroverted, thats probably also the reason of the number 3 tbh, i give up of things because i refused to get help

5- I HATE THIS ONE BUt sometimes i accidentally say something i shouldnt, like offend someone and only realise later ""oh my gosh i JUST Realised how i fucking messed with their insecurity"" at least this one is not very common for me to do, but my anxiety goes üìàüìà when i do it

6- im bad at talking about feelings so i cant really directly say ""i love you"", i would probably do it with actions, like giving a flower or giving some long hug

7- im not sure where should i fit this, but another bad thing is how i keep everything with myself, if im sad, stressed, hurt, im just going to keep it with myself, im just gonna pretend im okay with jokes and laughs 

8- i always lie and its honestly hard to get the truth out of me ngl, if i know im getting in trouble im definetly gonna lie, and no ""look me at my eyes and promise me youre telling the truth"" will work out tbh

9- last but not least is how sometimes i really think im better than others, i believe that im much skilled and different person, and when someone is showing their talents for some reason i think theyre showing off and ill be like ""pff my talents are way better than that"" (wtf so selfish lmaoüíÄüíÄ)

(Oh and i wouldnt say this is a bad point, but before doing risky stuff i like to think ""what if?""s so i know what to do in that situation, for example, if im thinking of skipping some 10 mins of class to be on on the phone at the bathroom (dont ask), im probably gonna think ""what if they ask what i was doing?"" ""What will be my excuse to explain?"" ""If i say such thing and they ask something else, what am i answering this time?"" Ok thats it)

I uh, think thats all, im sorry if i said something dumb or irellevant, this thing is too cofusing yet so interesting for me üò´
Also i looked so terrible and bad, i swear im not a bad person , my friends say they loves me ü•∫",mbti
intj vs. infj?,s4dspecter,1658548488,"Hi friends,

I‚Äôm still deeply confused about which one of these two types I am. I know about the cognitive functions, however I‚Äôm still finding it difficult to determine whether I prefer Te - Fi to Fe - Ti.

"I, an INFP, screwed up a bonding opportunity with an ENFJ",Affectionate_Hat494,1658537641,"My ENFJ friend and I had only known each other for about two weeks at that point. We work in a restaurant together, and it was slow that day. We hung out for about an hour just talking. We bonded over our high school experiences. He told me that in high school, a guy bullied him. It got so bad to the point where he had to get a restraining order against the bully. He then asked me how high school was for me. 

The thing is, something extremely similar happened to me. It wasn't as severe as his case, but the situation was very similar and unique. I should've told him. It's just that I was scared that I was going to cry. I wasn't embarrassed to tell him. It's just that I haven't spoken about it to anyone in several years, and it caused me a lot of pain. I think that I even have PTSD from the situation. I was never the same person after my bullying incident. I thought about ending my life several times. I wouldn't have told him about my suicidal tendencies, but it would've been a great bonding moment. 

I just didn't want him to think I was weak or fragile. I just kind of said that I was bullied a little bit, but I regretted not going to high school dances more often.",mbti
What type would likely be my soulmate?,depressedgod13,1658537543,"I‚Äôm a rising senior in high school. I‚Äôm a girl, I‚Äôm African American. I am perhaps slightly below average facially but thin and have a big butt (I look rlly tired and would likely benefit from wearing some makeup.) There have been people who seemed to feel I was average. I‚Äôve heard I have a unique look. 

I live in a non-black city (white and one other specific, common minority group) and basically have for my entire life, but have still had 1 boyfriend (ISxP.) He was black. We had communication issues even though I made documents to try and ensure that we didn‚Äôt. He disrespected my sexual boundaries more than once but claimed toward the end of the relationship that it had become toxic and blamed me. It was basically a bad experience, but it‚Äôs been 4 months now (feels weird to say) and I‚Äôd say at this point it almost feels like we never went out. 

I wouldn‚Äôt say that I have ‚Äúgood social skills.‚Äù I‚Äôm commonly considered to be an ambivert (but I feel like I‚Äôve been steadily becoming better at not caring a ton abt what other people think) but am not good abt having consistent friends and idk.

As high school is coming to an end, I‚Äôm growing to be annoyed w peers of mine who seem to still care abt popularity. 

I dislike people who I feel overly judged by/who seem judgmental. Sometimes when I talk I struggle to properly come up w what I mean to say? 

I think I‚Äôd like being around a person, even in a general sense, who I feel is good abt making predictions. I‚Äôm always posting abt wanting people to predict things. 

I don‚Äôt socialize a ton at my internship but am effective abt competing tasks. I do like how nice ppl seem and like it when ppl come in and make small talk w me or ask me how my day is going. 

I rlly like twilight zone and am asking my dad (who I have negative feelings toward) to get me paramount plus so I can watch original Star Trek on cable television. 

I don‚Äôt want to end up w a low income man. It‚Äôs possible I will, and I think my ex seems likely to end up being average income at best. 

I do think that maybe I have some ‚Äúdaddy issues‚Äù that I should probably discuss in therapy. I feel that I am male identified in a sense, like I sort of think abt ‚Äúmen‚Äù almost daily. 

Although what I‚Äôve been trying to think abt more lately is what kind of job I want to end up in. I‚Äôm torn between‚Ä¶ a lot of things, actually. I‚Äôm going to have to research jobs soon.

I told my‚Ä¶ IxFx (INFJ according to r/MBTITypeMe) friend who I met online when we met in person for the first time maybe‚Ä¶ this past weekend (kind of hard to remember) that I want to eventually become a housewife. Though I probably partly said that bc my mom does it. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going o end up career wise, but I do know I‚Äôve always intended to go to college and that I don‚Äôt want a job that is anything less than average income. 

I know I don‚Äôt want a longterm partner of mine to be like my ex, I sort of knew we weren‚Äôt compatible when we dated but rlly know it now (it wasn‚Äôt j a communication hung, it‚Äôs also that I truthfully think he wasn‚Äôt terribly ambitious nor as intelligent as I tried to tell him he was.

I posted to social media around 22hrs ago abt how I sometimes have the urge to write my life story, to sit down and write abt my life experiences - that I am simply a person living through history and we are living through such an intriguing time period. 

The two races of men who I am probably most attracted to on average are black and white. My longest ever crush was on a guy who is half black half white, an ESTP. 

I admittedly have anxiety due to I guess traumatic experiences like the police having come over to my house when I posted abt feeling suicidal online in the past (now whenever I‚Äôm going through a hard time, I just make a mental note to talk about it in therapy.) I‚Äôve realized that I‚Äôm probably not healthy enough to date right now, but hope that one day I will be.

I posted to social media around 22hrs ago abt how I sometimes have the urge to write my life story, to sit down and write abt my life experiences - that I am simply a person living through history and we are living through such an intriguing time period. 

The two races of men who I am probably most attracted to on average are black and white. My longest ever crush was on a guy who is half black half white, an ESTP. 

I admittedly have anxiety due to I guess traumatic experiences like the police having come over to my house when I posted abt feeling suicidal online in the past (now whenever I‚Äôm going through a hard time, I just make a mental note to talk about it in therapy.) I‚Äôve realized that I‚Äôm probably not healthy enough to date right now, but hope that one day I will be.

What‚Äôs wrong with INTJs,TalkaboutJoudy,1658530801,"Too pragmatic - you miss nuance and wonder. Apart from that, you lot are ok.",mbti
INTJ or INFJ?,ChosoMotochika,1658530595,"Okay so, I have been really torn as to who I really am, let me explain to you.  


First of all and to be more specific, I am torn between INTJ and INFJ, each time I get different results, I even took the cognitive function test and I end up always with Ni dom and a variation between Te and Fe as the second one, it was quite hard to decide.  


On one part, I am not as blunt as an INTJ, or as they assume they can be blunt since this can be stereotyped (although I suspect that, not from experience but from my own understanding of this type since I never really met one), not really cold, and I avoid saying something bad just for my own sanity and try to be nice to not make anyone argue with me and get on my bad side, but I am not as warm and welcoming as an INFJ, people get on my nerves, I can see right through their bullshit, I don't like to get into their business unless they came asking for help and I decided if that person really deserves to be helped or not, I have such great communication skills and I can easily convince someone of a certain idea and know exactly what they will say and what I am supposed to tell them to make them say what I want them to say if that makes sense (sorry if this appears as some kind of manipulation but I can't help it, it comes on its own).  


As a friend, I am nice, energetic, full of thoughts and creative ideas, like to exchange them, have a good conversation, lacking mental stimulation makes me quite sad, I do try to help my friends and I know exactly what to do to help them without them telling me that, at the same time, I require their effort too, I need their utmost loyalty and devotion to me and to do anything for me too otherwise I won't be satisfied and I become so cold and demanding, prideful as well, like prove me you really are smitten by me or you really really like me so that I will see if you are worthy of my time, quite arrogant right?   


I hate hugs, affection of any kind, pity, when things get too emotional I get overwhelmed and I quickly retreat, I hate talking about my feelings as well but wouldn't mind listening to someone talking about theirs as long as they are being genuine, and don't always talk about feelings (like some kind of a crybaby or too emotional, not my cup of tea, they can be quite the idiots who never listen.)   


so yeah lots and lots of contradictions here, puzzled till now, I am nto sure If I forgot to mention something else here because I have this feeling I forgot some points, but I guess these are the most important and obvious, now tell me, which one I really am according to your opinion and why?",mbti

What job do you predict I‚Äôll end up in longterm?,depressedgod13,1658521446,"I‚Äôve been at my job internship for the past week or so now (well technically started 2 Tuesday‚Äôs ago but didn‚Äôt start going in 5hrs daily until last Monday.) I like it, but I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs at a camp.

I‚Äôm still undecided on what I‚Äôll major in (I know I want whatever degree I get to be versatile to ensure that I won‚Äôt have to go back to college‚Ä¶ but for this to happen I‚Äôd also have to choose smthn I actually like, yet I also honestly care abt salary.) 

But, I know abt what I have learned so far from my job internship is that I enjoy organizing things if there isn‚Äôt too much to organize (by today there was too much to organize to a point where I was genuinely angry and swearing to myself.) I am a fast typist generally speaking, have always heard this since middle school. 

I know my legs kind of hurt partly due to my bed but also due to standing a lot at the internship. 

I do like how people there seem nice, even though I‚Äôm not wearing makeup (I am below average looking without makeup, but actually don‚Äôt know how I look with it.) 

I don‚Äôt quite *like* the feeling of waking up at 8am, but can handle it. It‚Äôs still tough for me, but I‚Äôve been doing it for yrs for school. I know it‚Äôs better for me to try, even during summer, to be in bed at a reasonable time. 

My supervisor did give a good report to the program director (I like her but maybe feel a bit annoyed sometimes bc I feel like she can unintentionally underestimate how difficult some of the tasks actually are.) 

I am efficient abt completing the tasks I am given. 

Something I do like abt the internship is the fact that it forces me to do smthn other than sit around the house all day, that the‚Ä¶ area is nice (like it looks nice outside, but doesn‚Äôt smell super great,) that I‚Äôm learning small new things, and that it‚Äôs forcing me to be independent. I feel more like an adult.

I like it when ppl at the internship come in and ask me abt my day, but wouldn‚Äôt want to talk to ppl a crazy amount one on one (I mean I like making small talk and conversing but still.) 

I rlly like movies and I guess analyzing human behavior which is part of why I‚Äôve been into Myers Briggs personality types for so many years. 

When I say that I care abt salary, what I mean by this is that I simply don‚Äôt want to end up in a job that is below average income (I mean, obviously since I struggle w depression and anxiety I care abt prioritizing my mental health too, but still.)

I say this bc my family is already in a low income bracket and I‚Äôve seen how we struggle (not as bad as it could be, but still.) 

I‚Äôm also kind of sick rn which may be impacting my mood, but still make sure to show up for work. 

I was v against going into engineering for a few yrs and was leaning nursing largely due to math not being my fave subject (I dropped pre cal in junior yr bc I didn‚Äôt learn algebra 2 well during online schooling) but also likely due to not fully ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù what being one entails? 

I feel like I actually do understand math when I scroll through khan academy. 

I plan to attain a bachelor‚Äôs, would actually be open to getting my masters but only if the job I ended up with paid well enough for me to be able to pay off any debt. 

I already know that I will be starting at community, I planned this as it is a mental health decision. 

I know I want to help ppl but I can also sometimes be v cynical abt people, I mean on the inside. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm ‚Äúoptimistic.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt have ‚Äúgood social skills‚Äù - I am introverted and can actually be v social or chatty sometimes, but feel especially due to quarantine that I sometimes don‚Äôt know how to ‚Äúbehave‚Äù even though I understand social norms and know how to be polite. 

I have never been ‚Äúpopular.‚Äù 

I liked chemistry a whole lot in 9th grade, like a whole lot. But haven‚Äôt revisited the subject since then. 

I dislike overly judgmental people and people who make assumptions particularly abt whether or not i am intelligent.

I‚Äôm black and have always lived in a mainly non black city, it is possible I will move at some point. 

I rlly enjoy watching movies and TV.

What do you think her type is?,depressedgod13,1658517261,"She‚Äôs the best friend of this girl who I‚Äôm pretty sure is an ESFx (either ESFJ or ESFP) or at least a close friend of hers. I asked this IxFx girl what she tends to be like, she suggested the girl is ‚Äúnice‚Äù - I perceive her and her ESFx friend as being kind of gossip-y or don‚Äôt like idk, fully trust them bc of it.

I remember after my ex and I broke up (I didn‚Äôt directly say why just posted ‚Äúain‚Äôt got no time for boys but have plenty of time for friends‚Äù) she and her ESFx friend asked me why or what happened in class (both were j being nosy.) 

I used to let her follow my spam acc which may have been a mistake (probably was.) 

She has a boyfriend who‚Äôs one of the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù guys a grade above us (well‚Ä¶ not a grade anymore, he graduated this yr.) He‚Äôs black. He gives off the impression of being sort of goofy, he follows me on social media. 

I unfollowed her on social media bc I was annoyed that she voted ‚Äúno‚Äù on my poll where I asked if you predict I‚Äôll have another boyfriend. Regardless of what her reasoning behind voting it was, it felt rude (it‚Äôs possible she did it to be shady bc I once was being mean-ish abt smthn her best friend did or seemed to be holding a grudge over it, or she may have been trying to make a logical prediction based on my race and where we live. Or she may j think I‚Äôll end up wanting to be single. Could be anything.) She may have noticed, but still follows me. 

She tends to vote on my social media polls. She is actually the only person who voted on my ‚Äúwhat MBTI type do you predict I‚Äôll end up w longterm‚Äù poll - she voted ‚ÄúISTJ or ESTJ.‚Äù

I get the impression that she tries to vote honestly on the polls, or like votes for what she rlly thinks. But that‚Äôs j an impression. 

Both the girls who I asked abt her described her as being nice or nicer than her best friend.

Any idea what functions could be responsible for this kind of thinking?,CyperFlicker,1658510715,"Trying to find my type and I collected some patterns in my thinking that I thought may help deciding on functions:

- I am always thinking about what is behind something, as an example a friend of mine showed me a video of a local event that happened a couple months ago (related to cars) and he was like ""look how cool are the cars"" personally I found the cars ok but I was thinking more about the vanity of something like this while people starve and I was wondering how much it cost, how many tickets sold, who organised it since it required some stuff that were missing from the market....etc.


- I find myself thinking about how events connect to each other and stuff like cause and effect, let's say an accident happened in front of me, I may start thinking that maybe if one of the drivers took an extra second checking his keys before leaving, or talking to a neighbor etc it could have been all evaded, or how none of the people involved knew that something like this would happen when they woke up in the morning.


- I am always annoyed about the short sightedness of people in general, like the people who litter, its like dude what do you think would happen to that plastic bag? do you think the magical trash fairy would teleport it to trash land where trash lives happily for ever? oh and I hate how politicans may ruin the future and development of entire countries for cheap personal gains that they don't even need.

- Recently I started getting more and more interested in stuff like self development and I realised how much time I wasted in my teens on entertainment so I started learning german (in case I ever traveled there, and I like learning languages in general) I started working out and joined a boxing gym (I hate it but It seemed like a good way to get over my fear of confrontations) I started learning to draw and I really want to learn guitar and electronics (dream of building a drone) but I can't afford those hobbies just yet.

- I've always been a sensetive kid when I was young (not sure if due to my own personality or due to bad upbringing) but even though I still am sensetive to some stuff (mostly yelling, being called stupid or being disrespected), I have been called selfish and I discovered that my face doesn't show as much emotions as I thought it did.

- I really want to do something great in my life, I don't know what it is which frustrates me but I don't want to live like the billions who lived and died leaving nothing to humanity.

However, I have also met several rude customers who are entitled, and I get angry very easily at them. From the moment they step up to the counter, I have already known what kind of behavior they would bring to me, and I would treat them with cold tones and simple request. I‚Äôm very sad because I can‚Äôt always appear happy and welcoming to every single person I have to serve in a day. My manager told me this morning that a customer said I was rude to them and I should be more cautious. I understand that and I‚Äôm not mad at the customers or my manager at all, I‚Äôm just mad at myself of how easy I am to get angry and how I‚Äôm always ready to pay back at people who are rude to me. Sometimes I just wish I could act it out, but it‚Äôs too hard when I‚Äôm always tired. Is this okay for an INFP to be this rude like me?",mbti

My Cognitive Functions - And the INTJ stereotypes,burying-my-mind,1658502910,"(Lots of text. Read the end)

Well I have been researching this MBTI topic for several months now and I am really very intrigued to know my exact MBTI out of curiosity. But after so much time of research, I got to the point where I am absolutely Ni, Ti, Fi. (In that order)

&amp;#x200B;

Starting with the fact that I have already done many tests, and I have repeated them several times, always looking for the best and the most recommended in the MBTI forums, 99% of the cases I get INTJ

(I've also done my own research, I know the tests has its holes)

&amp;#x200B;

So, the problem is that researching INTJs, all the descriptions of them are very promising, of super studious and orderly and immutable people with the great auxiliary Te. But researching about Te it is hard for me to consider that I am someone with Te, at least someone with Te developed.

I have a hard time literally identifying myself with such superficial descriptions, because these years I have had isolation problems and it was not until college that I became a studious person, before I was always someone with average grades, a lover of mathematics, science, physics, but he was not a studious person as described, he rarely studied but still got good grades y he was not order personified as described again.

&amp;#x200B;

Researching the functions a lot, I consider myself 100% dom Ni, but not auxiliary Te and that has cost me to identify with the descriptions of INTJ

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a chance that I'm a looping INTJ? Or that I haven't been able to develop my Te because of problems that have kept me away from the world?  

I had read that there are INTJs who do not develop their Te because they are in a loop that makes them not go out into the world for Ni - Fi, I don't know how beridic that is

What is the most extreme emotion you felt?,Ahriman___,1658495167,"I'm an INFP I guess.


So 4 years ago I was a 17 years old high school student.. and it was exam that time...

I kicked my classmate during that exam. 

I kicked him because he embarassed me. 


I was insane, irrational, mentally unstable that time. I didn't care about exam anymore. I just want to kick him for embarassing me in front of everyone.. and people were making fun of me.

It was the most extreme emotion I ever felt in life because normally I wouldn't dare to fight back. I'm actually very coward person.. 

but because I couldn't control emotions anymore I went insane. And what I couldn't understand is even tho I hate my bully I also feel guilty for kicking him and I can also hear my heart beating really fast time that time.. and everyone were shocked and staring at me like I'm insane person. 

So I was actually bullied since middle school, always embarassed by my classmates for being weird, loser, easy target, I was also always scolded by my teachers for being shy, stupid, ignorant, lack of common sense (well I guess that's my fault for hating to study), I was bullied on internet(and I admit now that I'm cringe thats why I get bullied.. but it still hurt my feelings when those cyber bullies reminds me of bullies in my school),  and my conservative(Islam) brother beaten me up because I stopped believing in Islam.

I keep questioning to myself ""What have I done to them?!"" ""What do everyone expect from me?!"" ""Why cannot everyone just let me be myself?""

So about what happens after I kicked my bully, he didn't fight me back.. I dunno why but he looks surprised. He didn't expected I would fight back. Luckily my teacher yell after and scolded the ones who bullied me. I was surprised that she didn't reported me to the discipline teacher. She saw me kicked my classmate in front of her but she still let me continue taking the exam. She actually knows that I'm being bullied. I wish there is more teachers like her.",mbti
Sensor Bias,Less_Breakfast3400,1658495138,"I am an ISTP that thought I was an INFJ for years. I scored it on my tests and my discord friends thought it was accurate. 

ISTP functions: Ti Se Ni Fe
INFJ functions: Ni Fe Ti Se

Easy to see how it could be mixed up as the functions are the same, yet different order. 

INFJs have hordes of media, writing, even memes talking about not being understood by others. I thought it applied to me. It did, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I am this personality type!

You don‚Äôt have to be an intuitive to be deep or feel like an outcast. Any Mbti type can be that way. Including a most hated type- ESFJ. Please chill on the judgement with them :(.

I write this post to say that the stereotypes and judgement prevented me from finding my true type for three years. I met many rude people that insulted sensors for no reason. This is a complete misunderstanding of Carl Jung‚Äôs Theory. 

I am an ISTP and I do not know how to repair a car. But I love playing guitar and singing. I write poetry. I am emotionally available. Because a Mbti type isn‚Äôt doomed to certain traits. They are cognitive functions that describe how we process information and the world around us. Not all ENFPs are loud and socially extroverted. Extroversion refers to the external world and interacting with it, not social situations.

Not every sensor is a bully I was bullied from elementary school to early highschool. I was the weird poor kid with shit clothes. Anyone can be bullied. Hell if you look on this sub you‚Äôll see people being bullied on the daily.

"Why is personality-database full of toxic, horrible people?",michaelpalinisdusty,1658487805,"Hi all, i'm very interested and knowledgeable about MBTI and it's a passion of mine, I've recently made an account on personality data base, and all I see on there are posts by arrogant, patronising people who just comment on every post they disagree with saying things like ""this person doesn't know cognitive theory"" or whatever. This hasn't happened to me, but I see it constantly. Why are these people so horrible? It's ruining the community. The craziest thing to me is that these arrogant people are usually wrong, they don't read the comments properly and then just take issue with the person's perceived lack of explanation, when it's literally just people posting

Honestly if you're one of those people that expects everyone to post full theses covering all the MBTI theories just to be able to type a 2D cartoon character without being subject to really nasty harrassment then you need to go away, meet more people and stop using the internet and forget about MBTI, it's not for you. I understand most of these people are very young, it's so obvious by how they talk down to people, but these people need to grow up because they're actively killing a community that's been around longer than they have, this weird protectionism is literally killing the community because it's not fun to theorise if people can't listen to each other's thoughts without being unnecessarily vindictive, it's also killing the community by creating loads of disparity between real theory and these keyboard warriors' need to protect certain characters and keep them in certain types, regardless as to whether or not it's true, it doesn't matter because they won't hear otherwise.

I think the reddit community is quite good and open, we allow free exchange of ideas and there's levels to the discussion, it's not dictated by anyone, I've had an account on personality-database for a couple of hours and all I see is people innocently posting their opinions with however much reasoning they believe is required, and then the dogs get set on them for not explaining which subtype in socionics they think applies.

INFJ becoming INTJ finding human interactions too algorithmic and gamified,socomfyrn,1658482316,"2 to 3 years ago i [22M] used to be INFJ with my SO [22F] who used to be INTJ at that time. Due to many problems and hardships i went through where my existentialist side started to show up i had to forcibly rethink every notion i had on the world and on the way i react to it. 

That's how i believed i would get better, deal with my insecurities, studies in engineering and the problems we had in our relationship. I started to see everything as something to be solved with an algorithm that ill save for when the same problem, or something similar to it, reappears so that i don't have to go through the unnecessary process of getting stressed and emotional about the situation.

 All in all im INTJ now and i almost see everyone else as NPCs with routes to follow and my so called algorithms to go through when conversing with them. Even with my girl. Even though i love her so much and i can't imagine the sorrow ill go through if i ever lose her, i still see the way i treat her as ""this makes her happy ==&gt; do"" and ""this makes her sad ==&gt; dont"". Its more detailed than this because of my ideals and the clear distinction of priorities i have of course. All of this made me work on myself and improve what i judged as a lacking side of myself and other parts of my life as well as accentuate on the sides that i know are good.

This made our relationship so much better that we even sit together to try to find problems to fix in our relationship and finding none. Im the happiest in this relationship than ive ever been. But it feels robotic to me when i think about it. As if im just playing a game.

ENFP in a relationship with ISTJ- I don't know what I'd do without him,lilac-latte,1658475286,"A lot of people say that an ENFP and ISTJ relationship could never work because of the vast differences in perception and judgement, but honestly I think that's what makes our relationship so perfect. Don't get me wrong; if we weren't strong communicators I could definitely understand how this type of relationship could go horribly wrong, but I love picking apart his mind and understanding how he views the world and makes decisions. I think he feels the same about me. Although we cannot fathom to think like one another, we understand how each other's minds work, and I believe that it helps us be more well rounded and developed people. Our cognitive functions are complete opposites: Mine is Ne&gt;Fi&gt;Te&gt;Si, and his Si&gt;Te&gt;Fi&gt;Ne. 

His dominant Si honestly helps me make more sensible decisions when asking for his advice, and vice versa. Since I literally have little to no Si abilities, it's hard for me to narrow down concepts into something concrete. Some things need this type of perspective, and he helps to give this to me. On the other hand, I think that I help him understand ""the bigger picture"" a lot of the time with my Ne, and with my perspective I think he's also able to see his situations differently and make better informed decisions. We love to give each other advice :)

As for the judging functions, I have always been a very emotional decision maker. Since Te is my tertiary function, it is hard for me to have structured solutions to problems that I know will work; I tend to try new things and can often be emotionally impulsive, and this can end badly. He helps me stay grounded, and while I obviously still primarily use Fi in decision making, he has helped the Te in me come out and help. It has greatly helped my mental state. For him, his Fi is tertiary, so he has trouble being in touch with his emotions in order to use them to make decisions. This is where there can often be some miscommunication because he still has issues identifying and communicating his emotions, but since we are strong communicators, I understand him, and I have been trying to help him strengthen his Fi (without wording it like that lol). He has a prominent history of depression and anxiety, so it's important that I help him be in touch with these emotions instead of bottling them up. He has definitely made some progress emotionally, but we're not quite there yet. 

I have seen a lot of people say that couples should always share at least one cognitive function, but honestly I prefer this. Sometimes understanding each other can be challenging, but I feel like we balance each other out and have prepared each other for the world (we are 19, have been dating for over 2 years now). I wouldn't have it any other way. I love filling each other's holes and seeing the world through each other's eyes every once in awhile :)",mbti

"Which MBTI type is most likely to be a criminal, based on EPQ?",Sobble-547,1658408796,"To recap, the Eysneck Personality Questionnaire gives you a score based on three categories; extroversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism.

Extroversion is pretty straightforward, basically the same as MBTI. So obviously it's associated with Extroverts.

Neuroticism is how easily nervous or tense you are. I'd associate this with Thinkers over Feelers.

Psychoticism is lack of empathy. I'd associate this with Polar Fe, or just not having Fe in your function stack. Basically Te users.

So that would mean that overall, ENTJs and ESTJs are the most likely to be criminals. I personally would choose ENTJs over ESTJs, as they are Ni users and would be more likely to develop a criminal scheme, while ESTJs' Si would have them prefer to follow the law.

Why the main line of criticism against MBTI should not dissuade you from engaging with it one bit,senteniel-,1658405630,"  
The main line of criticism generalizes from the fact that MBTI has low test-retest reliability (people test as more than one type across time), and construct validity (the data does not behave as one would expect if its basic postulates were true) to the conclusion that MBTI fails as a statement about what personality is. Poor construct validity and test retest reliability *is* a problem for MBTI as a personality inventory. It is *not* a problem for engaging with MBTI the way it is typically done. 

This is because it is the conceptual framework that motivates MBTI that is put into practice here on these forums, and by itself this does not generate testable predictions. Rather, it has spawned and continues to spawn diverse theories that do make such predictions, of which MBTI is one, for some domains of personality research).  It is simply a *way* of thinking about personality.

Therefore, when someone criticizes your very making use of MBTI (as opposed to any specific thing you are saying) they make a so-called *category mistake:*  They confuse a way of representing or thinking about reality for a specific representation or thought that reality is in this or that way. 

In practice, MBTI by and large behaves like a way of representing reality rather than a representation of reality because the theory of types affords a language with which to speak about similarities and differences between people. A language or conceptual framework *cannot* in principle be right or wrong. It can only be useful or useless; precise or imprecise; better or worse, etc. And here there is delicate balancing act in play: 

* On one hand, typology is a *language* with enough systematicity or grammar to generate well-formed statements about how things are. 

To exemplify, one cannot say that someone is both a T-dom and an F-dom (to say that is either not to say anything at all, or to say something in a different language than what MBTI offers). Similarly, one must speak as if there are certain similarities between Se and Fe and Te (because they are all e's) and other similarities between T and F (because they are rational functions) and S and N (because they are perceptive functions).  One not so obvious implication is that there is something that makes Fi and Fe both count as F's, and what one says about Fi and Fe cannot violate that rule (F must mean something such that Fi and Fe are both it) unless one ends up strictly speaking nonsense. 

* On the other hand, there is no set or agreed upon way of understanding what a cognitive function is exactly (although there are many suggestions about it), or what the specific functions and their attitudes refer to. There is no set in stone agreed upon conception of what makes Fe and Fi both F, and part of the beauty of forums like these is that we are engaged in a cooperative process of renegotiating the nature of every function by relating them to whichever domains of life we employ the language of type to make sense of: personality, interactions, behaviors, challenges, politics, experiences etc. 

In short, learning Typology is learning a vocabulary by which to make things recognizable for yourself and others that would otherwise remain hidden. It is something for one to master, which of course means knowing and respecting its limitations and dangers too. More importantly, one can by attempting to do so improve on it, because like all languages it is developing.",mbti
"The Introvert Dating Paradox (aka, my Dumb Thoughts on Introverted Romance)",Sobble-547,1658405323,"Okay, so I'm an introvert; ISTP to be exact. I haven't dated anyone before, but if I did I would probably choose to date an extrovert. It makes perfect sense - relationships are built on being able to understand and converse with your partner. An extroverted partner would find it much easier to connect with me than an introverted partner, especially one with dominant Fe. Besides, introvert-extrovert relationships are just really fun to watch.

So that's that, right?

Well...

I'm a bit of a fan of romance anime and dating sims, which I know is atypical of a Ti-Dom, but I digress. I tend to get very invested in a good romance, to the point where I even imagine myself as the male lead, interacting with the female characters and writing my own endings.

But I noticed something that had me a little confused. When it came a time for me to 'choose' a girl, I almost always chose the quiet, shy, mysterious introverted girl over the talkative, friendly, popular extroverted girl. It wasn't necessarily a conscious decision; I entered the anime/game expecting to make the logical choice of the extroverted girl, but I found myself drawn to the quiet girls instead. I don't know what it was exactly; maybe it was just seeing them open up to me over time and become bolder and more confident of themselves. I don't really understand it, but I never regretted choosing them.

When I realized the logical gap, I was understandably confused. Was my logic wrong? Or did I insist on making stupid decisions under the intoxication of being in a fictional world?

After some thinking, I believe I have an explanation.

Looking back on the logic in the first paragraph, the logic I had believed for the majority of my life, I realized that I was analyzing the wrong thing. I wasn't looking at attraction, I was looking at compatibility. It makes *sense* for an introvert to have an extrovert partner. I doubt I would ever go out of my way to approach someone I have an interest in; in truth, the thought of rejection or embarrassment is terrifying. It would be much more simpler for someone to approach me; even if I don't reciprocate their interest, it would be a much-needed confidence booster.

I didn't want an extroverted relationship after all. I was just afraid of making the first move.

With this in mind, it means that I really am attracted to introverted girls, which is perfectly understandable. Being able to see the bond between the two of you strengthen over time gives me a fuzzy feeling that I couldn't put into words if my life depended on it. Also, they're just so damn adorable. Whenever I see the quiet girl getting flustered or embarrassed, I can't help but smile like an idiot.

In the fictional world, I feel we are more inclined to make riskier decisions and take initiatives we wouldn't normally take. Consequences are much less relevant, and we become bolder people because we are less afraid of being bitten in the back by our dumb choices.

This is just my opinion. I could be wrong; I've been wrong before. But I'd like to know the community's thoughts on this.",mbti

I‚Äôm sick of being asked to give up my time to work torturous jobs just to be able to have the most basic necessities of life. And this constant pressure from the world that I‚Äôm supposed to want to work more, and want more money, it‚Äôs fucking ridiculous. So I‚Äôm forced to participate in a bullshit society, and in return I get an excess of money, which I can then only use to further participate in a society that has no place for me in my off hours as well as my forced working ones? Why the fuck would I want to do that? 

It‚Äôs like this whole system forces me to the point of feeling suicidal just to be able to eat and sleep somewhere dry, and the only things this system has to offer me as comfort for ensuring all that is that I can spend the excess money drinking with people I don‚Äôt want to talk to, or throwing parties I don‚Äôt want to be at, or buying clothes or furniture or tech I don‚Äôt want or need, or trying to impress girls into having sex which feels like more of an effort than a reward, or buying decadent food that isn‚Äôt even worth the excess calories, or getting a fancier house, or travelling, just so I can be depressed in a ‚Äúprettier‚Äù location for no reason. 

But because it seems that everyone else in the world wants at least one of these things, so if you don‚Äôt want any of it, there‚Äôs no concessions made, you‚Äôre just unlucky in that now you‚Äôre suffering has no pay off, you‚Äôll just work for no reason, accrue pointless wealth, and then die having never spent it cause it‚Äôs worthless if you don‚Äôt belong in this society and there‚Äôs nothing it can offer you.",mbti

anyone help me understand this/discover my mbti?,Omgaby123,1658380609,"Ok so i got to do the 16p a while ago in the website, i got as ENTP which i honestly can quite relate a LOT with it, but then i heard how trash that website is and went to 'sakinorva' and did the test again, but there i got ISTP which i can also relate somehow, so i thought that maybe if i throw my personality here as some people did i could get help, i tried to study it, but its just too confusing.
anyway
-------------------------------
- i would consider myself ambivert or ""fake extrovert"", although my energy goes üìàüìà when i go to some social event, specifically be with my friends, i would not consider myself shy as i really like attention though, im totally up to appear in public wearing pajamas and a dumb sunglasses, i dont give a crap about people opnions

- i really cant talk about my feelings, like no way im going to even mention my feelings.

- still about feelings i really also cant connect to others, i cant help anyone because im always looking to solve the problems instead of listening (but still i care about others and care if theyre alright and that im not harming them, even though sometimes it leaks and i end up offending them)

- im realistic tbf, depends on the situation, but most of the time im realistic.

- im also too honest and highly sarcastic im straight up gonna say "" i hated this "", maybe not just out loud so i wont make them sad, unless i already have some intimacy with em, so i say ""OOOoOoh ThiS is SOO prettYYy üòÄüòÄ"" in the most sarcastic way

- i have strong opnions about things, and its hard to make me change it when i pick some, im mainly open about them so im very ok on sharing them, i love it in fact, specifically when i can make some fun discussion about it

- i believe that i am somehow better than people around me, probably because of my skills.

- i wouldnt say im *good* at solving problems, i always try to give some idea but at the end if the day i didnt had any idea of what i was saying nor if it would even work.

- i also cant say that i would be a good leader, i love to and i panic when im not the one commanding something i know i was supposed to, i feel like everything would go wrong, so i do prefer being the one leading things

- also im not sure if this is even relevant, but i fear people with higher roles than me, like principals in school, police, people that could punish me in the society 

- im stubborn when smth is not too serious, if it is something im getting in trouble and cause stress im gonna obey, if not too serious, im not listening.

- im honestly chill, fun and funny its very hard to make me angry, but when i do i will hardly fight myself to prevent me from doing something stupid, like kicking their face. (Seriously my friends say i turn red and start shaking ü•∫)

- also mentioning about me being mad, if im touched in the right places i could pick a fight, being honest, i like getting in fights with people i dont like, just not the consequences of it later.

- im creative (no doubt im an artist) but my imagination isnt the best as i have aphantasia, so i prefer to keep things around me real, so i hardly get affected by any fantasy my head makes 

- i do consider myself a dreamer, gosh how my dreams are insane, i will dream about something that i dont even have experience with (a dream i had is become a professional animator, drawing everything by myself on my computer's mouse, very insane right)

- i consider myself smart tbf, i think how my actions today would be a deep consequence in the future, i can learn something just by watching, like the path to somewhere, how to use something by watching someone do it etc

- most of the times when i want to learn something im doing it because it interests me and im determined in following ir, like art for example, but if it have a higher role in society and would make my life somehow better though, im also willing to do that

Tests show my MBTI is INFJ my best friend is an IxFJ,clothie2,1658375725,"I think I'm more INFJ than anything else. 

My best friend is totally an FJ. I see him practically plan and do things for the future based upon what he wants and feels. He wants to do things based upon feeling and familiarity. Like running or rewatching tv shows. I do the same thing. It's not a routine per se, but it's I find comfort in knowing this let's keep doing it. Neither of us have concrete plans for the long term future (50 years from now), but we have steps aligned until then like being housemates and going to college.

We both like horror movies and the fake blood, but anything related to real life gore (epic fails, open infections, broken bones to him, needles and blood to both of us (he likes games like Call of Duty and Halo, which I have dabbled in (liked, but found futile)

I like games where I can design (both of us are creative, I'm mysterious, dark and twisted in an unorthodox kind of way, he's creative in a realistic I would have done that without my pain kind of way. I feel really heavily that this difference is impartial to an MBTI because I feel like I've seen a darker side to him where he loathes people and yet chooses to help them (like me), but how he lives with it is different because I have PTSD and Depression and childhood trauma, which I used to do when I was younger.

If either of us wants something we won't give up until we do it or it's obvious it can't be done (usually things wanted out of feeling and not analytics)

What degree do you predict I‚Äôll attain,hatelife176,1658374705,"I‚Äôm a rising senior. I plan to start at community but admittedly don‚Äôt actually have a good idea, as much as I hate to say it (I rlly do wish I had an idea) of what I‚Äôm going to major in. I used to always just say nursing, but I feel like I haven‚Äôt been open minded enough abt potential career options. 

I actually have come to care abt salary, and would *prefer* to end up w a high income job, assuming that there is a high income job that I can have w my skill set/the way I am. 

I am technically an introvert (a lot of ppl have felt I was an ambivert, in general.) I‚Äôm not inclined to say I have good social skills, especially due to the pandemic - for example the director of my summer program came by an hour or two ago when I was there and I was polite but didn‚Äôt properly know how to.. behave? 

I liked chemistry a lot in freshman yr (I tried studying it the summer beforehand.) 

I thought I would like AP bio and bio but my teacher was literally racist and so that kind of made things tough? Idk we learned nothing in AP Bio.

I‚Äôm taking psychology and physiology this upcoming school yr.

I have sleeping issues and am from a family that is probably low income, so my bed isn‚Äôt easy to sleep in which probably contributes to my sleeping issues. 

I also deal w depression and anxiety, but feel like I am becoming better at working on my coping skills for both. 

I do have a summer job internship which I feel is giving me a better idea of my strengths and weaknesses (sort of - I mostly help my supervisor our w tasks so it‚Äôs hard to say, to some extent.) 

For example, yesterday I had to move through cobwebs to count the number of boats, and I hated it. Today I had to organize my supervisor‚Äôs file cabinet, and found myself enjoying it (might be harder tmr bc I‚Äôm not ‚Äúdone.‚Äù) It was partly that she seemed to be fine w me taking my time on it. She gave a good report to the program director. Only issue today is that I was on my feet a lot of the time. She called me responsible. 

I notice, even though i assumed I would like it more, that I actually personally am not a gigantic fan of like managing the kids? Not that I‚Äôve directly done it but I feel like to some extent I don‚Äôt know how to ‚Äúact‚Äù even though I rlly liked having to sit and talk to this camper who sadly got smthn in her eye. 

I tend to be efficient and consistent abt completing my tasks, I liked what I was doing today bc it was so detail oriented. It was nice organizing smthn I think maybe it made me feel like I was in control. 

I feel like in regards to a college major if I‚Äôm rlly intrigued by the subject I could find myself getting into it? That‚Äôs how I felt abt chemistry when j was stil in it. I would be worried abt job prospects out of college though. I dropped pre cal  in junior yr due to feeling like I didn‚Äôt know algebra 2 well enough to actually succeed in the class (since I took algebra 2 online.) 

Whatever job I end up in, even though I def think I can like the feeling of knowing I put up in a lot of work (but I can also not like that feeling, I j wouldn‚Äôt abt to feel lazy or like I was j around and doing nothing,) I know I want to have enough time when I get home to sit down, relax, and watch some television :) 

I was curious abt aids in sophomore yr and have been into MBTI for a while and enjoy learning abt mental health and I guess idk j that sort of thing? I remember researching depression and anxiety when I was 10 to kind of learn more about it since I think around 4th or 5th grade I started to suspect that I was depressed (8 was!)

My mom was a social worker but quit her job due to the vaccine mandate and still walks around the house rlly toxic. My dad is still a security guard. I can honestly struggle w looking at both of my parents and seeing absolutely no hope for my future.

My great grandma apparently used to say my mom was ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù (and she probably was.) 

She was likely good at saving money as my mom mentioned my grandma had a lot of vintage Barbie dolls (that I actually remember) even though my grandma was a black child in the 50s.

**ISFP**: there‚Äôs a goldmine of quality lectures online. Parents who send their kids to thousand-dollar tutors are paying an IQ tax.

**INTP**: Right, though discussing learnings makes it stick for me. It‚Äôs also relieving to ask questions immediately, for someone inexperienced like me. To not be stuck rereading the same sentence for an hour. So I would prefer a mix of both.

**ISFP**: so you like talking in groups. hmm.

**ISFP**: Hey INTJ! You guys are exercising? for 5 hours??? My gosh, it‚Äôs boiling today!

**INTJ**: Hi, yeah, it is very hot.

**ISFP**: INTJ, you‚Äôre going on to study math?

**INTJ**: yes. I think they made a mistake with the offer.

**ISFP**: oh you‚Äôre so humble! You must have a strong foundation.

**INTJ**: no‚Ä¶ not really.

*ISFP activated a portal. They materialize in front of an old house which was almost falling to pieces. People streamed in and out.*

**ISFP**: we come from r/mbti, but before that, we lived in Facebook.

**Owner**: Oh really! I used to be a furniture store manager at r/mbti, and I just moved here last fall. This house right here was built in 1905!

**ISFP**: wow, I really adore the decorations!

**INTP**: yes, it‚Äôs lovely!

**INTP**: What‚Äî I was talking, just less because I'm tired.

**ISFP**: Why aren‚Äôt you replying to me, or my friends' texts?

**INTP**: Sorry... Checking notifications in the mornings is distracting for the entire day. And mornings tend to be productive times‚Äî I will reply to you after lunch.

**ISFP**: pfffff‚Äî Who are you, some CEO? Even CEOs have office hours in the morning, lunch and evenings!

**INTP: ................................** okay fine.

I like to be a leader, and now that I'm regaining confidence I want to do my best to be a leader at work and maybe make my team shine, not bossy but engaging

Good manners and kind to others but I don't always understand how they feel

Lazy, I need an input to charge me.
I love energizing music or songs that give motivation.

For the things that I find interesting I tend to churn out questions as if they were cookies and to analyze any point, I don't know exactly why but I have to, but in the end I think that's the way it is for everyone when something is interesting

I hate being manipulated, someone invading my space, taking orders

I worry that my reasoning makes sense, and I like to explain my reasoning about something I have discovered / would like to do / my strategies / something I have learned. Sometimes I even imagine what it would be like to be a teacher, I think I would try my best to involve my students.

Perhaps I maintain too much harmony, but I still try to say what I think if it is possible or if it is not too risky (obviously in a diplomatic way). I like to argue and on the internet I had a debate once.

Relaxed but also lively and playful, with strangers I am a little shy or with large groups, I don't get offended easily and I don't like to show it, unless someone tries to turn me around because I think it's important to be blunt.
I still get angry ""in secret"" or if I am one of a few close friends

I'm taking care to be concise but also accurate because I really want to understand what I am.
However, in times of stress I seem to become picky and irritable, sometimes even a little emotional thinking that everyone wants to spite me on purpose.

The first time I took the test I came out as ESFP, then Estp, I had some doubts about it and I thought that to be an extrovert I'm a little too unpopular and that probably doesn't mirror me so much :/

What job would I likely be happiest with based on this?,hatelife176,1658358457,"I‚Äôm a rising senior. I plan to start at community but admittedly don‚Äôt actually have a good idea, as much as I hate to say it (I rlly do wish I had an idea) of what I‚Äôm going to major in. I used to always just say nursing, but I feel like I haven‚Äôt been open minded enough abt potential career options. 

I actually have come to care abt salary, and would *prefer* to end up w a high income job, assuming that there is a high income job that I can have w my skill set/the way I am. 

I am technically an introvert (a lot of ppl have felt I was an ambivert, in general.) I‚Äôm not inclined to say I have good social skills, especially due to the pandemic - for example the director of my summer program came by an hour or two ago when I was there and I was polite but didn‚Äôt properly know how to.. behave? 

I liked chemistry a lot in freshman yr (I tried studying it the summer beforehand.) 

I thought I would like AP bio and bio but my teacher was literally racist and so that kind of made things tough? Idk we learned nothing in AP Bio.

I‚Äôm taking psychology and physiology this upcoming school yr.

I have sleeping issues and am from a family that is probably low income, so my bed isn‚Äôt easy to sleep in which probably contributes to my sleeping issues. 

I also deal w depression and anxiety, but feel like I am becoming better at working on my coping skills for both. 

I do have a summer job internship which I feel is giving me a better idea of my strengths and weaknesses (sort of - I mostly help my supervisor our w tasks so it‚Äôs hard to say, to some extent.) 

For example, yesterday I had to move through cobwebs to count the number of boats, and I hated it. Today I had to organize my supervisor‚Äôs file cabinet, and found myself enjoying it (might be harder tmr bc I‚Äôm not ‚Äúdone.‚Äù) It was partly that she seemed to be fine w me taking my time on it. She gave a good report to the program director. Only issue today is that I was on my feet a lot of the time. She called me responsible. 

I notice, even though i assumed I would like it more, that I actually personally am not a gigantic fan of like managing the kids? Not that I‚Äôve directly done it but I feel like to some extent I don‚Äôt know how to ‚Äúact‚Äù even though I rlly liked having to sit and talk to this camper who sadly got smthn in her eye. 

I tend to be efficient and consistent abt completing my tasks, I liked what I was doing today bc it was so detail oriented. It was nice organizing smthn I think maybe it made me feel like I was in control. 

I feel like in regards to a college major if I‚Äôm rlly intrigued by the subject I could find myself getting into it? That‚Äôs how I felt abt chemistry when j was stil in it. I would be worried abt job prospects out of college though. I dropped pre cal  in junior yr due to feeling like I didn‚Äôt know algebra 2 well enough to actually succeed in the class (since I took algebra 2 online.) 

Whatever job I end up in, even though I def think I can like the feeling of knowing I put up in a lot of work (but I can also not like that feeling, I j wouldn‚Äôt abt to feel lazy or like I was j around and doing nothing,) I know I want to have enough time when I get home to sit down, relax, and watch some television :) 

I was curious abt aids in sophomore yr and have been into MBTI for a while and enjoy learning abt mental health and I guess idk j that sort of thing? I remember researching depression and anxiety when I was 10 to kind of learn more about it since I think around 4th or 5th grade I started to suspect that I was depressed (8 was!)

What do you think his type is?,hatelife176,1658355878,"He‚Äôs  my ex. I first came to know of him because he was dating this girl who has a lot of problems (bipolar disorder, was below average facially to me, seemed a bit ‚Äúoff‚Äù based strictly on vibes when I met her and like she could be somewhat toxic) - he had a crush on her for years, there are 3 votes ESFP for her on r/MBTITypeMe and 2 votes ISTP. I remember I was surprised to learn she had a boyfriend at all, as even though her body is conventionally attractive (which he pointed out at one point) I j rlly didn‚Äôt see it for her. But he had her as his profile pic when they were dating. 

I was also surprised bc she had a non-feminine sort of energy to me personally or j didn‚Äôt seem like the sort of girl who would be crushed on? But he‚Äôs bisexual so (said he was only out to his mom.) 

He has an IEP and was taking pre algebra as a junior which I had never heard of before I started dating him. I remember first time we went out, he suggested he wants to be famous and didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd go to college. He‚Äôs black our city is non black 

I assumed that the relationship was going great‚Ä¶ and I was wrong. In September 2021, he posted to his story (I followed him and he already followed me, I had texted his account to get her number) about feeling suicidal and abt how the relationship was over (though he may have posted that to his close friends which he added me to after I sent texts comforting him.) He posted abt how he loved her and I remember he had texted me not long before then asking if I‚Äôd heard from her and mentioning he hadn‚Äôt ‚Äútalked to her in a month.‚Äù He actually asked if I had her address, which surprised me bc I assumed considering they apparently dated for months and he knew her in middle school that he had it‚Ä¶ 

Like I said, he added me to his close friends list and in November actually added me around thanksgiving time to his list of women he was grateful for (on his close friends list.) I had texted him a few times making sure to check in, at some point on a certain day I remember he had texted maybe 3hrs later and asked me why I care abt him so much (I responded, he suggested my response ‚Äútouched his soul.‚Äù) 

we had art together and I checked in on him once, I remember the first time I ever met him (I had made sure to introduce myself to him bc I was curious abt who the girl was dating - I shook his hand and was surprised by how normal he looked, though I remember he struck me at the time as being really unusually quiet. Like he talked real quiet and low to a point where I couldn‚Äôt quite tell what he‚Äôd said, at least at first.) He was also sort of like that the first time we went on a ‚Äúdate.‚Äù I remember he later on mentioned to me that when he‚Äôd first met me he‚Äôd been thrown off or smthn by how erm cheery I seemed, I think? 

But basically in November 2021 - he already had my number bc I‚Äôd given it to him so I could check in and so he could talk to me since he was taking a social media break - he texted me sort of nervously confessing to having romantic feelings for me. I was surprised, he asked how I‚Äôd reacted. I said we could start w hanging out, which is what we ended up doing. I sort of arranged for it, bc he said he had ‚Äúnever been good w social interactions.‚Äù

We hung out the first time, I was extremely surprised by how well it went. I‚Äôm an ISFJ and felt like it was the start of something new. I remember he played a part of his Kanye west album (the one he liked) for me, he pulled down his mask a bit when we were first walking around and I was surprised bc I immediately liked his face just fine. I didn‚Äôt have a good impression at all of how he looked beforehand, j knew that he was overweight (I‚Äôm being honest here.) We walked around and talked a bit, he seemed reflective and not particularly immoral or anything like that. I ended the night telling him I liked him too and he smiled under his mask. At first it was normal and cute

And early on he was good at remembering things about me. .

We did that a couple more times (went on unofficial dates) and were in our talking stage. It was December by this point, by the way. At first it was really new and exciting - there was a bit of an issue along the way bc his ex‚Äôs best friend (who later on set us up but) told him to say we could kiss after I had asked him the day prior so he could ‚Äúconfirm feelings‚Äù (he apparently still had feelings for his ex at the time, which I had not known.) I was angry but he seemed genuinely remorseful over text and like he was really willing to clear things up. I could tell it was genuine. So we talked, I chose to forgive him.

I was still getting annoyed w how long it was taking him to ask me out, and directly mentioned this to him after he suggested he‚Äôd ‚Äúlet me know after break‚Äù on whether or not he‚Äôd ask me out. I texted him annoyed abt it as we‚Äôd already kissed and held hands, he responded and suggested that he had wanted to say yes earlier but felt it to be ‚Äútoo soon.‚Äù After that we started officially going out. He bought me stuff, the relationship started out normal and healthy. 

Of course‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt end up being normal and healthy. It started w little things like him admitting to having a p-rn addiction which I think bothered me (though he seemed to feel really bad abt especially considering what he admitted to watching, like genuinely guilty) more than I let on. 

But it wasn‚Äôt j that, it was also other things - like us never being able to agree on whether or not the school should get involved w his ex and ex‚Äôs best friend threatening to fight me on sight and threatening him too (he actually did seem concerned abt me and nervous about it, yet also seemed to feel his mom had resolved things and that I was overreacting by wanting the school involved - it was an impression, but it caused negative feelings, especially since I knew it was possible we wouldn‚Äôt be together forever.) 

And in hindsight I also now remember that he suggested the school partly shouldn‚Äôt get involved bc he ‚Äúknew people‚Äù and his ex‚Äôs best friend ‚Äúknew people‚Äù and if people knew they would take sides. Which I thought was a horrible concern. But he still suggested I could tell the school if it made me feel safe.

When I remember him, smthn that comes to mind is that he could sometimes like idk‚Ä¶ sometimes come off like he was rational or valued being rational (and later on told me in an argument that I think did lead to our breakup that I was being irrational abt my feeling he didn‚Äôt text me enough when he was busy w house stuff) but other times rlly came off like he had low self esteem (though later on in the relationship, toward the end of it, I felt like he didn‚Äôt come off like that as much) - like he would always shake his head sadly if I said he looked cute. 

And he could sometimes idk erm from my perspective overreact to things a bit? 

What I mean by ‚Äúoverreact‚Äù is that for example when I suggested that him saying he could see how people (like my former best friend and that entire friend group who I had beef with in middle school to a point where I confessed to making accounts where I told them to die but who he never unfollowed) might find me talking loudly in public ‚Äúannoying‚Äù had made me cry or smthn he said when we face timed the next day that he had felt sick or something literally bc of what he said to me due to the extreme guilt or smthn? He sounded like he meant it, too (I‚Äôm remembering that voice lol.) He seemed to feel rlly guilty or at least said he did 

And then when I was considering breaking up, I think due to my sexual boundaries having been disrespecte more than once (I considered breaking up a few times throughout the span of that relationship) he figured it out based on what I said over text and wanted to face time and mentioned he was already having mental health problems and seemed just idk? I remember he mentioned how he‚Äôd ‚Äúnever been good w girls‚Äù and started describing the issues in some of his relationships (all of which were online except for the most recent one w his other ex) and abt how all his exes had dumped him. 

He admitted to me at one point that he was a ‚Äúbad kid‚Äù in freshman yr and used to steal from stores w friends (not a terrible amount but) and was once chased by the police. But looked like he felt bad abt it 

We ultimately ended up breaking up anyway, bc after that argument that I described earlier (the one where he kept saying I wasn‚Äôt being rational) he had us go on a week long break (claimed it works perfectly due to his parents‚Ä¶ but I suspected one of us would lose feelings, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would still love him?) He admitted to me when I came to him in the middle of the week long break that it was bc he felt our relationship had become toxic and pretty much suggested it was bc of me (which is, in hindsight‚Ä¶ not true lmao.) I cried felt rlly bad and promised to work on it ij therapy (I actually did.) 

We got into an argument on FaceTime maybe not long after that as I was making a document of rules for better communication in our relationship and was annoyed w him again bc he was trying to claim that by suggesting our relationship becoming unhealthy wasn‚Äôt one sided I was refusing to take the blame (I ended up pointing out to him that he had rolled his eyes at me after we argued which is a form of passive aggressiveness, he suggested it was not passive aggressive even though it LITERALLY is.) His mom took his phone away bc his leg was already hurting 

He didn‚Äôt directly break up w me but kept extending the week long break (I think his mom wanted us to break up.) When he came back to school we still spent one of the days together of the school week - my behavior had legitimately improved, I was being nicer, but I felt based on body language that he was no longer as into me (I was obviously right.) 

I learned he had blocked me from his story, I texted him abt it we ended up breaking up for good. He suggested we could be friends, I didn‚Äôt want to be. I ended up blocking him entirely and the day afterward went out with my friend (well two days after on a Sunday) and posted ‚Äúain‚Äôt got no time for boys, have plenty of time for friends‚Äù (he saw this a few days later. I know bc his friend unfollowed me and he blocked me from the one account I hadn‚Äôt blocked him from.) 

He also texted me asking for some of the stuff he gave me back - more than once, even though we already arranged a day for it. I did give them back - I wanted to hand them over in a trash bag, but my mom wouldn‚Äôt let me. I threw his stuff down. He obviously noticed as in Art when we were leaving class he pushed past me.

I actually complained on my private spam acc and since he‚Äôs an asshole, he told a teacher and the teacher called his mom. His stupid mother texted me saying she‚Äôd need to get the office involved. I made sure to tell her all about him in response (I was called into the office anyway and told that my venting abt him was ‚Äúdefamation of character.‚Äù I complained, of course, abt his disrespect of my sexual boundaries.) 

He seems like he‚Äôs changed a bit in terms of clothing. He still looks REALLY tired. I don‚Äôt know where he‚Äôll end up career wise. 

I once mentioned my therapist called CPS bc of smthn my older brother did, he suggested or smthn like that that I could have j told her to not (I explained to him that that‚Äôs not how it works, that she is a mandated reporter. I know from his perspective it may have seemed different but I quietly can‚Äôt help but feel now like that was dumb.) 

I‚Äôd personally be surprised if he ended up in a high income job longterm, though. I know that he was depressed but when I think of his vibes and energy I j personally don‚Äôt feel that he seems like the type that will end up in a high income job. 

Sometimes, as I‚Äôm actually doing stuff and life is progressing, it feels like we didn‚Äôt rlly even date or like I never had a boyfriend?

ENFJ friend started being nicer after lecturing me,Affectionate_Hat494,1658354795,"My friend and I work together at a restaurant at our university campus. Despite us being the same age and being hired at the same time, he got promoted to department lead. It's basically like assistant manager. One day, my friend realized that I didn't ask people for their student IDs. We ask them for their ID so we can give them a student discount (the discount takes the tax off). My friend saw that I gave a staff member the discount.

He asked me when we were alone how much I charged the guy. I told him, and from that, he knew that I gave the customer a discount. I could almost see the gears turning as he tried to figure out what to say to me. He was super nice about lecturing me, saying that a couple days before, the same guy got into an argument with another worker because they didn't give him a discount. My friend kept emphasizing that it wasn't my fault; the guy was just a jerk.

My friend is always helpful at work, but he seemed to be extra nice. He spoke in a softer tone. He went out of the way to help me even when it wasn't necessary. He had nothing to feel bad about, but I can't tell if a part of him still felt guilty regardless",mbti
ISFJ vs INFJ?,United_Analysis1172,1658354717,"What's the difference between an ISFJ and an INFJ? I feel like I have many qualities of both but am not sure what the difference really is.

My ISFJ qualities:

I like to help others

Trustworthy 

Dependable 

Loyal 

I value order and structure, but I'm not necessarily organized. For example, I'll have a set goal in mind but won't used to do lists, planners, etc. Example: I want to start studying at 12:00 everyday and stop at 2:00.


My INFJ qualities:

I like art, and I like to create things but I'm not necessarily good at it so I don't know if that counts üòÖ For example: I'll create some for fun on Canva, but nothing by hand.

I am imaginative, but not to the point where it affects my everyday life

Reserved

Hates confrontation and conflict

I am introverted, kind, observant, sometimes sensitive, can pick up someone's ""vibes"" pretty quickly. I am also an overthinker and am not a fan of change unless I know exactly what's going on.",mbti

What do you think her type is?,hatelife176,1658329690,"She‚Äôs my acquaintance (I met her in middle school, we met bc she is childhood friends w the girl who is now my former best friend.) I remember that she never struck me as being particularly ambitious in middle school - both of her parents are engineers, but she doesn‚Äôt give off that vibe herself. She suggested to me when I asked her what she plans to do job wise that she wants to go into acrobatics and school doesn‚Äôt have much to do w the jobs she wants. She is technically Asian.

I remember she was friends w this introverted girl who I think is a 5w6 (who I personally think is likely an INTJ but ppl on this sub had different guesses) in middle school and seemed closer to her than she did to my former best friend even tho my former best friend tended to idk describe her w admiration

I get the vibe or got the vibe she had been depressed since elementary school (idk if it‚Äôs that she was r-ped back then or if she‚Äôs j one of those ppl who became depressed young.) I also always got the vibe that she was maybe bullied in elementary school 

I remember she was nice to me even though my former best friend started being mean to me/basically had me kicked out her friend group toward the end of 8th grade? Like she was nice to me before I gave the graduation speech 

She posts a lot of social media stories and has (had?) me on her close friends list, for at least over a month. She added me after I tried texting her idk comforting her this one time a few months ago? 

I know she was in rehab in sophomore yr and know she was r-ped by a few boys (she never gave a specific timeline but I personally got the impression it was within the past 3yrs.) I seem to remember she started smoking pot in freshman yr. 

She posted maybe‚Ä¶ last week crying on her stories abt how she ran away from home and suggested her ISFJ mom ‚Äúbeat her ass w words‚Äù and that her ISTx dad suggested that having kids was the worst mistake of his life and more or less suggested she was an accident or said smthn that made her feel that way. She hasn‚Äôt been posting as much since then but posted to her close friends story recently w my former best friend and this other girl from middle school that said ‚Äú4:20.‚Äù She actually suggested that ppl giving her advice (which I have tended to do) makes her feel worse that she feels bad bc she can‚Äôt get her life together on her own. But still hearted it when I asked if she wants to hang out some time (she said her parents called her the problem child and that she feels like she has to keep it together for everyone and that she‚Äôs surrounded by millions of people daily but feels like no one loves her)

She once suggested in a story that she is ‚Äúpoly.‚Äù I remember she had a boyfriend in 8th grade who I think she was still with going into 9th, but I personally get the vibe that her experience w the boys who abused her changed her perspective on guys (it‚Äôs clear to me that she and the kid broke up, though that likely would have ended up happening anyway.) 

I‚Äôve always gotten the vibe that she was bullied at some point. I remember my former best friend could lwk seem almost protective over her (though I noticed a few months ago that my former best friend actually unfollowed her from my former best friend‚Äôs main acc. So I figure maybe smthn happened briefly?)

My hypothesis about mbti function,tiraein,1658320572,"I am a Korean who is interested in mbti. It's an intp type. I don't know much about the exact eight-function theory or Jung or Myers. However, when I kept looking at the 8-function table and applied it to the world I saw, an interesting hypothesis came up. 
I think 8 functions can be handled not only by personality but also by concept. It's impossible to write all my thoughts, so I'll write down the summary that's just a hypothesis. It would be somewhat mathematical.

Ti = point
Te = Arrow
Si= rays
Se=Both-way arrow
Fe=face
Ne = unsteady bouncing (upward from 2D plane)
Pi = the corner where the bounce is oriented,
NI = a straight upward line in a fixed direction 
And the dots again = Ti

It is based on the premise that the order of 8 functions acts in the order of Fe-Ne-Fi-Ni-Ti-Te-Si-Se. I applied it to human or world trends, but I won't say it because it's too long. Also, I think we can divide it into *fe (ne-fi-ni) / (ti-te-si) *se and I think it's connected whether it's a cascade or a circle. And I think Ti=ne, te=fi, Si=ni, Fe=se can also be used accordingly.

I'm sorry I didn't say all the ideas that were the source of the hypothesis. And you might also not understand or think it's a strange idea. But nevertheless, I wanted to put my thoughts into the world. If you already have a similar idea, please let me know.",mbti

"I would like a clarification on how the judging functions work, thanks",planetj100,1658311329,"I can't really relate to any of them as of now, since the descriptions I've seen just don't fit who I am. If I'm honest I believe that some people are complicating things and I would like some clarification on how they actually work. I don't wish to blaming others so sorry if that sounded that way. I'm likely the one overthinking and have the wrong definition. Here's how i relate to them:

Fi: Is often described as self-awareness and knowing how you feel about a situation. Making a decision based on how you feel - I make a lot of decisions based on gut feelings so i link that together now and then, but the rest just isn't me at all. If I were the Fi-dom that people describe, I wouldn't be here saying I have no idea what my type is.

Fe: Have never understood this one if I'm honest. Simple as that

Ti: This one is difficult for me too. The way it is described confuses me. So on that thought I definitley have the wrong definition again.

Te: Same as Ti. I can't imagine having 2 ways of logical thinking. I obviously have one of them, but since I only have 1 way of thinking I find it hard to imagine other ways. Also the way this function is described suggests that Te user cannot be lazy in any shape or form and I haven't ever seen anyone who isn't lazy in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: The descriptions/stereotypes of the judging functions confuse me and I would like some clarity on how they work, since based on these descriptions/stereotypes I can't relate to any of them.

this post probably comes of as a bit aggressive but I promise that there's none there, even under the surface. If anyone could clarify the judging functions and explain what stereotypes are true and which aren't true that would be great. Thanks again",mbti

Stack and upbringing.,MisterNuggets,1658306634,"Hey folks!

I was reading about the functions and the stack and the shadow functions, and a question popped in my mind.

From what I gathered from tests, I‚Äôm an ENFP. My parents are INTJ dad and ESFJ mom. I‚Äôm not sure how to phrase this- while I was looking deeper into functions I realized that Fe and Ti are strong in me (ie, I‚Äôm actively trying to create harmony around me, and to be the most accurate possible, as long as my values are respected). So from here, there are two possibilities. Either I‚Äôm a mistyped ENTP with some kind of Fi inflation, or being brought up by Ti and Fe doms kinda boosted these functions that are not supposed to be in my stack as an ENFP.

Is there any ressource that could help me learn more about this, or at least help me figure this out?

While I‚Äôm at it, is there any study or work that talks about cognitive functions in regards to Gifted and/or HyperSensitive people? I‚Äôve found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/8o8v8y/gifted_children_intelligence_cognitive_functions/) but is there anything else?

how to deal with my entj bf,United_Capital_4040,1658289119,"I'm a 17-year-old female (intp) and I recently met a 19-year-old guy on a social network. The moment wespoke I was able to connect with him in a way that 1 hadnever done with anyone else before: he attracted me ALOT; his intelligence, life experience and way of speaking. That's because l hadn't seen him in a photo  yet and I still didn't know how handsome he was.

He and l are different people, but in some very pleasant way, we understand each other. I soon found out he was an entj, and that explained a few things. We kept talking and it was always really nice, talking to him
made my day and once things started to get romantic.I realized that I loved him and he, that he loved me. More than that, we matched by complementing each
other: and we understood each other because we want the same things and our values are very similar. 

However, we live 1500km away and we are both very young. This creates a lot of problems because the chances of us having something concrete are very low
and it's honestly disheartening. Lately we have been talking less: in fact this attitude started from him from one moment to another leaving me very confused. i asked what happened, he just said that he just wasn't paying much attention to it, but that he still didn't date,
kiss or whatever with anyone else.
He's pulling away and I don't know if it's because      he doesn't see a future in the relationship (despite loving me and clearly sees me as an ideal partner) or because I've suddenly stopped being attractive. I miss him but I don't know if he cares anymore and I don't want to
seem needy. I'm also confused because he lied about not having instagram for me, which made me feel really bad, after all, it shows that he doesn't trust me. This and other withdrawal behaviors started suddenly, because before he trusted me so much.

What I want to know is what you think is

Do you predict that I will end up being a housewife?,hatelife176,1658287342,"So, I got back from my summer internship maybe at abt 1pm today and know that even though yesterday I was rlly enjoying it, today I rlly hated it. The main issue is that today I had to count the boats, and so I did‚Ä¶ but idk, it was just so so hot outside and finding the boat number was hard especially since the boats were so wedged together. There were cob webs and I had to lift stuff up and my hands were getting dirty. And you know what? I HATED it. I didn‚Äôt communicate that bc of course politeness, but I hated it and I felt like crying bc I j feel like it‚Äôs the kind of work a man should be doing. 

And I was noticing how I‚Äôm getting these rlly bad bug bites all over my face (well actually j on my forehead) which is contributing to me being below average. Even though I felt so good yesterday, I felt terrible today. I j rlly learned that getting my hands dirty doesn‚Äôt work for me, I rlly did feel like it was a man‚Äôs job. 

But it wasn‚Äôt j that. It was also depressing for me bc I think on some level deep down inside I look at my parents, at how we are low income, and I feel like I‚Äôm headed down a path potentially of just ending up in jobs like this (I mean it‚Äôs an internship but still) where I‚Äôm a busy little worker bee who works so hard for god-knows-how much. And I hate that. 

I was thinking this morning abt how I don‚Äôt see a point in going to college just to end up in a low income job. 

I find ppl interesting, even tho I can also rlly struggle w feeling like humanity can and does suck. I‚Äôm into MBTI and have been for yrs though I know it‚Äôs arguably pseudoscience. I also find mental health interesting. I do want to help people and like helping my supervisor w tasks, it‚Äôs j hard on days like this when I already didn‚Äôt get much sleep and maybe didn‚Äôt wake up feeling fantastic bc of it. 

I dropped pre cal in junior yr in part due to feeling like I wouldn‚Äôt need it for a future career but also bc I felt like my course schedule was already too busy w ap‚Äôs and Spanish 3 (not that I studied hard for those classes bc I decided to start at community.) 

I enjoy helping my supervisor out w small tasks sort of today I think I was just rlly not feeling it. It‚Äôs odd bc yesterday I felt rlly good like having to socialize at work was helping me but today i think some anxiety was creeping up on me 

My family environment isn‚Äôt great tho I intend to transfer and my sleeping schedule mental health and self esteem are also not fantastic though j actually feel like I‚Äôm developing better coping skills I regards to dealing w all. For example, today I was almost crying over how exhausted I look but tried in spite of how hard it was to take a step back and consider why I do look so tired and then work on being hydrated and make a goal to be in the bed no later than 11pm 

I liked chemistry in 9th grade

People on Reddit voted when I posted abt my father that I seem to have daddy issues. I am in therapy but feel like I don‚Äôt actually see my therapist often enough. 

I feel a lot of guilt over how my older brother who is in rehab turned out, more than I think my mother does unfortunately. I‚Äôve always felt v bad abt what I feel may have been my involvement in how he has turned out. 

I‚Äôm watching ‚Äúwe need to talk abt Kevin‚Äù and wondering if I‚Äôd actually make a good mom even though I used to talk quite frequently abt having kids in Spanish 3 this past yr. The movie is also v fascinating to analyze, to see how the kid turns out (nature vs. nurture)

I think she underestimated how difficult that actually is, to find numbers that aren‚Äôt immediately visible on multiple boats.)

She seems to trust me p much w counting my own hours or didn‚Äôt keep specific track of them even though for my program I need a certain number (she was gone a few days last week and even tho I sent her the number like she asked I actually j pretended I did a little more than I actually did.

How you deal with love ?,Nanaqa,1658276129,"yah the title is kinda weird but i need external opinions especially from others mbti types FJ/FP bc you guys are comfortable with your feelings.

- How do you deal with love ? i mean love is good only when it's reciprocal  but when it's not reciprocal it can really hurt , and even if it‚Äôs reciprocal we will always end up getting tired of the person in front of us , All the parents I know are all broken up or don't love each other anymore.

And honestly it makes me neither want to get married or fall in love because it's a waste of time , i‚Äôm sorry if it sound ¬´ cringe ¬ª or ¬´ unhealthy ¬ª but that‚Äôs my opinion and i‚Äôm still young and maybe my opinion will change when i grow up but currently i see love as a ¬´ good-bad ¬ª thing 
good because ur happy and feel good but it's temporary , you'll end up breaking up and being heartbroken. As an unhealthy ENTJ ? my functions are not well developed and personally it‚Äôs cringe and hard for me to confess my feelings , i‚Äôm working on it to be more confident and comfortable w my feelings but it‚Äôs really hard to say ¬´ I love you , I miss you , i love spending time w you ¬ª because i don‚Äôt want to feel weak or vulnerable , my love language is mainly ¬´ gestures ¬ª for exemple : give you flowers , spend time with you , laugh , do or finish your tasks , clean ur room etc..

**Introvert ‚Äì When interacting with things outside of their own mind (the external), they prioritise the ways they can subjectively process the external. They also have in mind how to fulfil their desires in a long term, realistic way, and they will seek to fit the external into this. They prefer to be primarily functioning within their own mind; this could be experiencing one‚Äôs own emotions and impressions, this could be forming beliefs and opinions, this could be sifting through their mind‚Äôs knowledge, this could be them imagining things ‚Äì what matters is that the activity is contained within their own mind.**  

**Extravert ‚Äì When interacting with things outside of their own mind (the external), they prioritise the external in and of itself over any ways they can subjectively process the external. What is objective is prioritised over their own personal quest. They prefer to function in a way that extends beyond their own mind; this could be writing, this could be talking, this could be asking questions, this could be playing sports, this could be playing a musical instrument, this could be laughing or crying, this could be cooking, this could be playing a video game, this could be using any of their five senses ‚Äì what matters is that the activity extends beyond their own mind.** 

**(Jung, 2017, p. 5; pp. 330-333)**

**Cognitive Function definitions:** 

**Ti - Taking action (within your mind) based upon an intellectual stance you have formed yourself.** 

Te - Taking action based upon an intellectual stance from the external world that you have adopted.  

Fi - Taking action (within your mind) based upon adherence to values you have set in accordance with your likes and dislikes. 

Fe - Taking action based upon adherence to values other people have set in accordance with their likes and dislikes. 

Ni - Looking within your mind, in a very open minded way, for information in the form of underlying principles. 

Ne - Seeking information in the form of underlying principles through taking external action,  in a very open minded way. 

Si - Looking within your mind for information in the form of specific, concrete information rooted in sense impressions.

Unpopular Opinion Amongst the MBTI Community,NightDreamer73,1658274050,"Telling new people in the MBTI community to study the cognitive functions first in order to type themselves is the worst advice ever. That's like handing someone a trigonometry textbook when they should be doing basic algebra instead. 

All it's going to do is probably scare them away, or they'll simply not get it and give up. Cognitive functions are difficult to understand even if you've been part of the MBTI community for a while. It's best for new people to start off taking some MBTI quizzes first. Will they be mistyped? It's quite possible. But it will at least help them wrap their head around what the MBTI is before deciding to further research it. Then they'll probably have an easier time understanding what the cognitive functions even are.",mbti
I need help typing my character!,boatsir,1658273822,"I like to do this kinda sorting stuff with the characters in my series just for fun, and my other 3 mains were pretty easy but I‚Äôm having trouble with 1 character in particular. I‚Äôm sorry this is gonna be long.

Outwardly, she comes off as very aloof, chill and ‚Äúcool‚Äù, and callous. People tend to not like her at first, because she tends to steal a lot, do a lot of drugs, and can be really blunt, confident and cocky. She has no issues with people disliking her, and actually prefers that over the complications of being liked. 

But that facade fades pretty quickly, she‚Äôs actually incredibly vulnerable and, most of all, very genuine and caring. Because of her own issues, she has a hard time coming across as protective or loyal, despite it being very obvious she is even through her ‚Äúcool‚Äù persona. She‚Äôs the kind of person to watch someone she cares about do something and you can just tell in her face that she loves them, despite not being able to say it. She‚Äôll remember small details about people and bring it up in a casual way to not make it a big deal. She will go along with whatever stupid or boring (to her) things her family or friends want to do, just to help out. It‚Äôs very accidental, like this care is coming out of her, even if she tries to hide it with this aloof attitude. She has super meaningful conversations with people and seems to know exactly what to say to get others to feel better, even at some of the other character‚Äôs lowest moments.

She‚Äôs very thrill seeking, she does a lot of drugs to cope with loneliness and gets energized by doing things to put herself in danger, like start fights or cause havoc, like a very alt self-harm method that still requires being around other people, even if they are trying to hurt her. She has little to no care for herself or her own needs, she actively hates herself and sees herself, in a very matter-of-fact way, as a terrible person, like it‚Äôs common knowledge, despite none of her family or friends agreeing. As much as she comes off as confident and chill, she really isn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs the type to die to save others, and will do it for anyone in a heartbeat. Very protagonist of her.

She‚Äôs very skilled with guns and weapons and acrobatics. She usually notices small details better than anyone else can, and actually becomes kind of interested in becoming a detective. I‚Äôd call her the ‚Äúuncle friend‚Äù, she‚Äôs 19/20 and idk she‚Äôs not very motherly or even fatherly, something about her reminds me of the reckless but protective uncle, especially since her story is mainly about her relationship with a 13 year old boy that later kinda becomes her younger brother who she can be all paternal over.

What major would likely lead me to a job I‚Äôd be happy with?,hatelife176,1658267752,"So, I got back from my summer internship maybe an hr ago and know that even though yesterday I was rlly enjoying it, today I rlly hated it. The main issue is that today I had to count the boats, and so I did‚Ä¶ but idk, it was just so so hot outside and finding the boat number was hard especially since the boats were so wedged together. There were cob webs and I had to lift stuff up and my hands were getting dirty. And you know what? I HATED it. I didn‚Äôt communicate that bc of course politeness, but I hated it and I felt like crying bc I j feel like it‚Äôs the kind of work a man should be doing. 

And I was noticing how I‚Äôm getting these rlly bad bug bites all over my face (well actually j on my forehead) which is contributing to me being below average. Even though I felt so good yesterday, I felt terrible today. I j rlly learned that getting my hands dirty doesn‚Äôt work for me, I rlly did feel like it was a man‚Äôs job. 

But it wasn‚Äôt j that. It was also depressing for me bc I think on some level deep down inside I look at my parents, at how we are low income, and I feel like I‚Äôm headed down a path potentially of just ending up in jobs like this (I mean it‚Äôs an internship but still) where I‚Äôm a busy little worker bee who works so hard for god-knows-how much. And I hate that. 

I was thinking this morning abt how I don‚Äôt see a point in going to college just to end up in a low income job. 

I find ppl interesting, even tho I can also rlly struggle w feeling like humanity can and does suck. I‚Äôm into MBTI and have been for yrs though I know it‚Äôs arguably pseudoscience. I also find mental health interesting. I do want to help people and like helping my supervisor w tasks, it‚Äôs j hard on days like this when I already didn‚Äôt get much sleep and maybe didn‚Äôt wake up feeling fantastic bc of it. 

I dropped pre cal in junior yr in part due to feeling like I wouldn‚Äôt need it for a future career but also bc I felt like my course schedule was already too busy w ap‚Äôs and Spanish 3 (not that I studied hard for those classes bc I decided to start at community.) 

I enjoy helping my supervisor out w small tasks sort of today I think I was just rlly not feeling it. It‚Äôs odd bc yesterday I felt rlly good like having to socialize at work was helping me but today i think some anxiety was creeping up on me 

My family environment isn‚Äôt great tho I intend to transfer and my sleeping schedule mental health and self esteem are also not fantastic though j actually feel like I‚Äôm developing better coping skills I regards to dealing w all. For example, today I was almost crying over how exhausted I look but tried in spite of how hard it was to take a step back and consider why I do look so tired and then work on being hydrated and make a goal to be in the bed no later than 11pm 

I liked chemistry in 9th grade

"Which type is the most likely to ask ""What if"" and ""Why"" questions?",morrauch,1658265859,"I find this to be a core personality trait of mine. I ask questions and I ask a lot of them, from a lot of people. The questions could be about something I've experienced, something I've never experienced or something that I could never experience. Some questions are grounded in reality and some are completely out of the blue ""Why the fuck would you ask me that"" questions.

Along with this, I tend to ask ""why"" a lot. I ask it in response to the answers to my ""what if"" questions very often. I also ask this question a lot when I'm studying/internalizing information. Like lets say I get a statement such as ""An ionic bond forms between two charged species"". I ask why does this happen, find the answer, then ask more ""why does this happen?"" Until I really understand what's going on. To be fair, this is partially also a learned study technique so I am not sure how much of that is the ""real me"". Though, I'm a young adult which means my personality is finally kind of ""settling"" into itself which means this kind of development wouldn't be unheard of in personality. 

I understand this kind of question will not give me an answer on which type I might be. I'm asking for a general idea, since I'm debating which of 4 types seems most like myself. I've consistently found myself relating to INTJ, ISTJ, INTP and ENTP profiles. I know these types seem to have nothing but the dominant thinking function in common. It's why I'm so confused over it too.   

I find observing my own cognitive functions to be practically impossible due to not only personal biases but also mental health issues which greatly distort my thinking and perception of myself. Internally INTJ or ISTJ seems the most likely, though most people would type me as INTP, which I would also say is a fair assessment. ENTP is the least likely but also a typing I've gotten several times. Perhaps I'm a sensor in denial.",mbti

Do you think my mom is an ESFJ or ESFP,hatelife176,1658263319,"My mom will be 50 on August 4th. She is still conventionally attractive w good makeup on, but is now overweight (once mentioned she lost the weight after having me - I am her youngest child - but regained it) so I guess still average looking, especially since we are black. 

She is a ‚Äúhousewife‚Äù but I occasionally joke to myself that in a sense, our family is a deconstruction of the typical American family dynamic. Even though she was conventionally attractive for a long time, my mother still ended up marrying a man who does not make enough money to support the housewife lifestyle, who is emotionally abusive, unintelligent, and most likely an alcoholic (my father.) 

She herself is opinionated but not as intelligent as she believes herself to be (is very against the COVID vaccine to a point where she is letting it impact her ability to find another job - she quit being a social worker due to the vaccine mandate. Yet doesn‚Äôt have any money saved up for if her and my father potentially divorce, and is still w him even though his emotional abuse is definitely part of the reason why her son is presently in rehab and has abused drugs so badly that he doesn‚Äôt behave anywhere near the same as he once did.)

Ever since she quit her job due to the vaccine mandate, our family has had some more financial problems‚Ä¶ but she still rationalizes things as ‚Äúthe vaccine is terrible, it‚Äôs not my fault it‚Äôs the government‚Äôs‚Äù (this is really how she thinks about it.) there was one day last week when I wasn‚Äôt rlly able to eat much at all due to her decision making (as in we j literally did not have enough food in the house‚Ä¶ but if you ask her it‚Äôs still abt the vaccine mandate.) 

I suggested that her hitting my brother makes her a bad parent (her hitting him when he was little) she got angry/annoyed like she tends to and suggested that ‚Äúeveryone was getting their ass best in the 70s and 80s‚Äù (whilst simultaneously being almost somewhat playful but also still having this bad sort of energy she always has when she‚Äôs rlly mad abt smthn.) Though I did notice she seemed somewhat upset last night when I suggested her parenting is largely why her son is in the position he‚Äôs in now 

She used to wear makeup around the house but doesn‚Äôt as often now and doesn‚Äôt rlly leave the house much either. Her parents have both died in the past 7yrs (her mother when I was 10, her father last‚Ä¶ August?) She is below average at this point without it (obviously not Horribly so) 

She was not a great mom to my brother herself, if you can‚Äôt tell. She had abusive parents (well, her father was, her mother moreso sounded too lenient) and was sexually abused and has j never ‚Äúhealed‚Äù from it. She also got into a car accident when younger and I remember was like idk, smthn happened when I was 3 (I think maybe someone assaulted her or smthn? I don‚Äôt remember the specific details but remember she still was a good mom when I was a child anyway.) I remember her accusing my dad of having ‚Äúset her up‚Äù for the incident that happened when I was 3 or smthn when they were arguing 

She does have a sense of humor, I‚Äôd argue she was too lenient w my brother sort of but she a fair amount of the time will tend to blame him more for the way he has turned out 

We live in a primarily white and Asian city still in part due to the fact that she struggles w internalized racism (she wouldn‚Äôt call it that though) but I think it‚Äôs also j bc we‚Äôve never actually had enough money to move anywhere else 

She was trying to be a rapper in when younger (she never finished college and had to get her GED bc there were these girls who were trying to fight her or smthn) and met Tupac once. She‚Äôll sometimes talk abt ppl having tried to fight her multiple times when she was younger but won‚Äôt actually see a therapist 

She smokes weed to ‚Äúde stress.‚Äù I suspect she has undiagnosed depression (she really doesn‚Äôt take good care of her appearance anymore she‚Äôll put on makeup if we go out but there‚Äôs a noticeable differ nice in how she idk presents herself. I do think my brother going to rehab has a lot to do w it)

She‚Äôll occasionally talk abt not conforming to a hive mind mindset or smthn along the lines of that or how you shouldn‚Äôt believe what others want you to but I think or she was raised 

she mentioned she partly ended up w my dad bc she used to be ""crazy"" (throw things, that her grandmother said she was.) I really think it would have been beneficial for her to seek out some kind of psychological help, but w the way my mother is it‚Äôs j obvious at this point that she‚Äôll never do that 

i have a lot of negative feelings toward her and my father. i j think its insane she let my brother turn out the way he did

She is religious but walks around the house swearing anyway, is always telling me to read the Bible

She is still fake a fair amount of the time in dealing w people though even though she‚Äôll also kind of complain abt others being fake

She screamed rlly loudly at me and sort of threw smthn down (not at me just down) a few wks ago when I was upset abt how my concealer wasn‚Äôt actually working. I really sometimes just don‚Äôt like her, I mean I j sat on the ground crying and she still ‚Äúapologized‚Äù but tried to rationalize things like they were sort-of my fault. It was even more annoying bc she kept saying I don‚Äôt need concealer even tho I actually do have p bad eye bags.  

I rlly don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs a good parent or even person and privately feel she likely shouldn‚Äôt have had kids at all. She‚Äôs just problematic.

I‚Äôm actually coming to have a fair number of issues w her as I grow older j bc even though I understand that she experienced serious trauma growing up‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like she j refuses to do personal introspection (not that she completely lacks self awareness) and acknowledge that her life actually really is in a horrible spot‚Ä¶ that she has just not made any truly good life decisions, ultimately.

Am I Ni dom?,lkanter0,1658257984,"I have always doubted about wether I am ni dom or ti dom.

I don't remember a lot of things about my childhood, but everytime I ask my mother about how my personality was at a younger age, she always tells me that I was very serious and never talked to them about emotions or about everything a child would talk about with their parents,she also jokes with saying that I was like a robot, because I never talked (not because I was shy just because I didn't want to) and always did my chores without asking me to do them, I also used to get very good grades. 

Right now I am very doubtful about my dom function, I still act like the child I used to be but now I am more open when talking and very honest. I also realized that I may have very good Se because even when I zone out, I am still aware of my surroundings, this also happens to me when I am reading a book, I zone out but when I come back I realize that I am still reading and understing it. As I said, do zone out a lot, I daydream a lot. I also realized something that happens to me very often, last time it happened was yesterday , and its that I do conclusions without realizing or something like this, for examle, a situation that happend in a family gathering years ago , in that moment I didn't matter to me and I didn't try to understand it, in fact, I totally forgot it years later, until yesterday in the morning, i woke up and remembered it and also had a conclusion about what really meant, it's so weird and I don't know how to explain it. Another thing that happens to me a lot is that whenever I am thinkg about some topic that I don't have knowledge about it I end up with an answer, for example, the last week my brother was feeling ill in some part of his body and I explained it to what may be the cause, he ended up asking how did I know it but I just have the answer. I do see a lot of hidden meanings in body languages and know about someones intention. The bad thing about me is that I don't realize that I am feeling some emotion until I think about it.

Ne or Se or something else?,artemisxstars,1658257916,"I‚Äôve been studying into a lot about cognitive functions recently, so it‚Äôs been on my mind a lot. This means i‚Äôve been automatically analysing a lot of what I do and think, so I‚Äôm able to figure out my dominant function (which i‚Äôm stillll unsure about).
I think i‚Äôve narrowed it down to Ne or Se (not 100% certain) but I wanted to ask which dominant function the following thought process sounds more like:

For example, i‚Äôll be looking out a window and sort of admiring the surroundings, noticing certain things- such as windows on houses etc. Then my brain will like think of something related to whatever i previously noticed- using the windows as an example, i‚Äôll be thinking if anyone will be able to see me through that window. This will lead on into a spiral of other thoughts and questions- ie. imagine if there was a girl who started waving at me, then, but what if she was actually a ghost? etc etc‚Ä¶
Sometimes i‚Äôll even remember a conversation from earlier on in the day or longer and start to relate things i see to that.

The reason I was confused between Ne or Se was the fact i was very aware of my surroundings, noticing certain things and having an eye for the aesthetics, but at the same time my mind will be wondering down different paths, remembering things (although i do this significantly less) or creating absurd but sometimes more realistic scenarios.

TLDR: I would say i‚Äôm often in the moment, but my thoughts can easily wander and come up with scenarios inspired by the things that i‚Äôm currently experiencing or situations from earlier on in the day (or week). This is why i‚Äôm very conflicted between Ne or Se (or even other functions if people think they fit better- i‚Äôm definitely not an expert on functions yet).",mbti

The only negative comments I've read on other subreddits are just some people expressing their frustration at being MISTREATED and MISUNDERSTOOD.

It's sad that some people take this to victimize themselves, when they are the majority in society.

Being ""sensor"" is considered the default in society. The normal. Anything else means that you're crazy, weirdo and a misfit. 

People join the MBTI community to finally feel understood, and accepted that they're not crazy. To understand why they're different. These are my reasons anyway.

Do All Designers Have to Have High Fi?,ErnestHemingbird,1658252683,"I'm an ISTP, and I've always had a well attuned aesthetic sense. However, as much as I'd very much like to, I'm not sure one can be a designer without high Fi. 

Aesthetics is partly based on mathematical senses of proportion, symmetry, asymmetry, etc. So far so good. 

But, there is an enormous amount of arbitrary decision making in the design process. A floral pattern isn't ""better"" than stripes, blue isn't ""better"" than red, flat moulding isn't ""better"" than dental moulding, doric columns aren't ""better"" than corinthian columns. To make these decisions, a designer or architect has to make a choice, a somewhat arbitrary one, and it seems to me that the fierce sense of right and wrong design decisions comes from having high Fi. The decision has to be made because the designer feels a strong, inherent instinct that one choice is right, and the other wrong. It isn't objective, and it can't be ""figured out"", and making the choice difficult, even for someone with high Se, like me.

I think an ideal designer is an XSFP. Sensory aesthetic sense, with the high Fi to make strong decisions about subjective matter.

TLDR; High Fi makes the subjective design choices a matter of personal conviction, circumventing a difficult choice for someone with low Fi.",mbti

Do you think it‚Äôs important to achieve a balance between your 4 mbti traits?,M-sly-C,1658244417,"I don‚Äôt exactly mean to achieve almost 50% of that and almost 50% of the opposite, because balance is about weight and not volume. Everyone has intuition and sensing but everyone prefers something. That means if you use sensing but prefer intuition, it seems to cause more struggles or it has more ‚Äûweight‚Äù. That‚Äôs why 70% and 30% (if we say that we can use percentages to show how much you prefer it) can also be balanced for someone. It might however be possible that you almost completely prefer thinking and almost never use feeling even if it could (that‚Äôs the question) be the right decision to focus more on feeling because your feeling might not actually have such a huge weight and your thinking/feeling is therefore unbalanced.

"HEY INTELLECTUALS, PUT YOUR TYPING KNOWLEDGE TO TEST",coffeeandangst,1658242447,"Hello. So I tried studying cognitive functions but it was still pretty confusing for me and I can't seem to grasp where I fit. I really wanted to know which mbti I am as I wanted to use it to navigate and know myself more. When people ask me what's my mbti, I wanna answer without any doubts. I wanna be sure that this type is really my mbti. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can you, an intellectual, help me with your vast and impressive knowledge? Even if it's just a practice, I would love to hear your analysis :D

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So first off, I am an introvert. I value my comfort and freedom a lot. When deciding about things, I tend to be rational before but now, I think I have changed. I now weigh my decisions if it would affect my comfort or not. I make sure that the decision I've made is what pleases me, not others. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like going out. I only go out of the house like once or twice a month. But sometimes, I do find it a little fun to see other people. You know just looking out for some pretty faces and having the chance to dress up. I like dark and neutral clothes. Also, I tend to wear casual smart types of outfits. Something simple and elegant. Oh and I tend to live inside my head, getting lost in my fantasies. I don't live in the present, my mind is always wandering off almost all the time. I seek stimulation and get bored pretty easily. I don't want an ordinary and boring life. I want something that makes me feel relevant while doing the things that I love. 

&amp;#x200B;

I like compliments and I take the effort to look impressive to others. I am always mindful of my manners and etiquette. I have a laid-back approach to life and  I would rather pass up opportunities if I know it would stress me out and if it would take a lot of my energy. I get stressed out and depressive easily (I also have pretty bad anxiety which makes me wanna unalive myself sometimes) 

&amp;#x200B;

Deep emotions really affect my choices in life. Especially sadness. Like, I almost failed my 12th grade for barely coming to school 'cause I think all the stuff we do in school is pretty useless and really does not help students to find what they really wanted to do in life. I was very depressed at that time 'cause I didn't like the way my life was. I would be very much willing to attend classes if it's something that I wanted to learn or something that I would really enjoy rather than studying subjects that are forced on me. But after all my absents, I still managed to score my tests pretty high which is why my teachers and classmates think I was wasting my potential.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, school is really just not for me. I hate being tied down and forced to learn. I freaking hate deadlines and such stupid rules that do not even make sense. I cut classes a LOT, it could be because the class is boring and we have nothing special to do or the class is just purely irrelevant for me. But the fact that I have to finish college, and adhere to strict studying takes the soul out of me. But at the end of the day, I know school is pretty important if you wanna get somewhere in life (but that's not always the case). That's just how society works and I have to freaking deal with it whether I like it or not because I am part of the society.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, when I do things, like house chores or whatever it is that requires physical actions, I always do the easiest, efficient and fastest way to finish things. Additionally, when doing school work, even when it was a bit difficult, I always find a way how to do it in an easy way without having to stress myself too much. For example, we were required to do a shit ton of research papers. It was intimidating and burdensome at first but I managed to convince myself that it wasn't that hard since I've got a lot of resources and I know what things to type on the internet to get my work done. In the end, I did pretty well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would also prefer working alone than with groups. I can be pretty intimidating as people say cause I always look annoyed and when I talk, I look straight into their eyes but I just trained myself to be like that. I was really scared of eye contact before and I was always anxious when talking to people, so I taught myself to just fck it and be myself. If they see me as cold, intimidating, or a bitch then I don't care anymore. I just wanted to be comfortable in my own skin without pleasing other people. I used to have a pretty bad people-pleaser personality where I would put myself in an uncomfortable place just to please people and appear likable. But that's not me anymore (thank god I changed). I have accepted my flaws and parts of me that may seem displeasing to others but so what? That's just me and as long as I'm not hurting or stepping on anyone, then there's nothing wrong. I think our flaws make each of us unique and distinct from each other. And honestly, I find that charming.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanna live and have fun. I love laughing and funny things but at the same time, I can get pretty serious with things, even if I don't want to take things seriously, I can't help it. Sometimes I envy those people who seem to be really carefree.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not good at detailed planning. I only weigh out my options like, if this doesn't work out then I'll do the other and if both don't work, then I'll just do whatever the hell appears in my mind. I don't stress it. I can be indecisive sometimes and if that happens, I would need a lot of time to think. But once I have decided on something, it is set in stone, like, I rarely doubt and change my decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also tend to lose and forget my things a lot. I used to be organized with my stuff, but now, I just place them on my desk or on somewhere I can easily see and pick it up. 

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to my emotions, I am pretty emotional but I don't show it and I hate crying in front of others, it makes me uncomfortable. And when I watch someone crying, even if it's just a random stranger crying on the internet, it kinda makes me teary-eyed I don't know why and I hate being like that. But when it comes to my feelings for other people, I can detach myself easily. I can like a person right now but also, I can turn off my feelings for them easily the next day if I want to. I am not much into romance but I'm open to it if it comes to my life. But I would just rather die alone than force myself to be with someone I don't fully like.

&amp;#x200B;

I rarely develop feelings for someone. I can only count them on one hand. It's because I think the people I encounter are no good or very boring. I've had a schoolmate in the past who tried courting me for four years but if I don't really like the person, you wouldn't catch me giving in. I felt sorry for him but then, I don't force relationships. If I'm getting into a relationship, I have to be really head over heels for them and I have to be really sure of them since my feelings can be quite fickle. But if I choose someone, I am 100% in, no doubt.

&amp;#x200B;

I can be quite distant and affectionate gestures makes me cringe. But I don't necessarily hate it, in fact, I really really appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't have specific ambitions in life. All I wanted is to have a contented, peaceful, and happy life with lots of money of course. But if the path to acquiring a wealthy life drains the life out of me and takes away my happiness and freedom then no thanks. I would rather be simple and happy. I would also rather do the things I love and die early than live a long and boring life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate small talks. If we talk, it better be something interesting. I want something thought-provoking. I can be pretty snarky sometimes. When I'm stressed out, I isolate myself and I snap whenever people talk to me.

With a large group of people, I am super silent but whenever I'm alone with someone who was more silent and shy than me, then I have the courage to lead the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

In books and movies, I can almost always predict what would happen but I can't seem to apply that in real life. The only thing I can predict is the intentions of people who come toward me.

&amp;#x200B;

I tend to play first then work. In the mornings, I take it easy. Then midday up to 6 pm is when I seriously do my work. Then at nighttime, I am fully unavailable, it's 'me' time. Like, you cannot really bother me at night to do something. I'll ignore it and only do it the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also very private and hard to crack. I haven't told a lot about myself aside from this post. Even my closest friends don't know a lot about me. They only know the basic things about me and that's it. It sometimes makes me feel sad that no one would discover who I really am but that's okay 'cause that's what makes me appear mysterious to others (as they said). I am also pretty melancholic. Like I could be all happy and giggly then the next minute I feel empty and sad. I don't know why, it just seeps in. Like, I am really existing in this very moment, I am here.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from that, I tend to be pretty understanding of others. I know if someone is feeling awkward or anxious and I do not judge them. I also understand if something might offend or hurt the other person so I always make sure that does not happen or I try to lighten the atmosphere. A specific example would be a misunderstanding in the family. My mother can be pretty insensitive sometimes and I know some of her words totally hurt my sister so what I would do is, I will convey my sister's point more broadly and in detail. In that way, my mother can easily understand the perspective and feelings of my sister.

&amp;#x200B;

I also tend to follow my personal values a lot and tend to rebel against my parents if what they wanted doesn't incline with what I want. If someone has shown me concrete evidence, I would still believe my own conclusion. I also love wondering about the unknown in this universe. For example, the theory about aliens or parallel universes, I believe in that and am very interested in reading about it. But my older sister found it absurd and unbelievable every time I talk about it and it kinda annoys me. How can you just believe what science has only discovered? The world is vast and the possibilities are endless. I wanna live long enough to know what the world really is. I wanna know what comes after death, what the world would look like once I'm gone, and is reincarnation real? Will I get to exist again? But of course, these are only silly thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

In arguments, I can get pretty feisty to prove my point. I give out analogies to specifically convey my argument. And if someone asks me for help, I try my best to be as specific as possible, like giving out every detail 'cause I know it might make them anxious if they don't know every little thing to do, especially if they are new to the situation. I've been there so I understand.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, this post has been long enough. I made sure to type down what I think are the important aspects to help me type myself haha. Thank you for keeping up with this lengthy post.

If you could give an advice on self-improvement...,poopiegloria_16,1658238428,"Up until now I still struggle about being confident. I genuinely believe that out of all personalities, I'm at the biggest disadvantage.

I'm an INFP, Type 5, Melancholic-Phlegmatic. In this society where extroverted ways give you a boost, it's a daily struggle for me.

You have to be good at communicating and getting along with people to get ahead in life - networks are everything now that natural selection's gone - from my observation. Being able to empathize and communicate is the new skill people have to learn to survive... And it's this area where I'm so bad at because I'm socially impaired due to traumas. I find it difficult to connect with new people, and maintaining most of my old relationships is such a chore.

Few conversations already tire me, and I can only handle a few people in a day. Once I get off work, I'm drained because I had to talk to people and put up a fa√ßade. The time I spend every night is only enough for me to recuperate.

Most people are turned off by my stoic appearance. I'm quite stiff in first impressions, mainly because I'm not comfortable enough to show humanity in me, to express any vulnerability. I seldom have interest to mingle either because I half believe they'll only hurt me. Which is something that's true the longer I spend time with people.

I've already had some say mean stuff to me because I'm too closed off, they usually interpret my silence as arrogance or rudeness. This dislike starts in my first conversation with them: I miss emotional cues so rapport doesn't build up. Things get awkward. I'm not much of a humorous person either so people will find me boring... That's how I am at first, at least. I'm quite relaxed and different when I feel safe with the person I trust.

I don't blame them. I don't take their reactions to heart either. Or maybe I do, but I don't cry about it anymore. I can understand why they act that way. People are generally reacting negatively to things they don't understand. And yet, even if I know this, I can't help myself.

But I do want to get out of this cycle, as it sabotages opportunities. I'm already a decent listener/empath, I just don't know how to adapt well with different personalities. 

I'm well aware that I'm socially inflexible, so I'd love to hear from all of you, especially high Fe types (since I've learned how to empathize by spending time with ExFJS). But if you're not an ExFJ, you're very much welcome to share. Multiple perspectives help a lot.

Do you predict that I‚Äôll have kids?,hatelife176,1658209043,"I‚Äôm an ISFJ.

I‚Äôm a rising senior who plans to start at community and feels like I don‚Äôt have a clear direction in mind of what I‚Äôll be majoring in. 

I know that within the past yr, I‚Äôve intended to take college more ‚Äúseriously‚Äù than high school (I actually took 9th and 10th grade quite seriously due to a desire to start at university but changed my mind due to my struggles w depression and anxiety summer before junior yr, as my mental health had reached a rather bad point.) 

I know that the fields I am considering majoring in are all listed here. 

The one that I am admittedly the least sure abt is probably engineering - it‚Äôs odd, bc I actually think I would enjoy figuring out how things work and am curious abt different systems and what makes things in our world work‚Ä¶ but I dropped Pre Cal in junior yr due to feeling like I never effectively learned algebra 2 well enough during online schooling, so I‚Äôd be ‚Äúbehind‚Äù the typical engineering student. 

Math past I guess addition and that sort of thing is not my ‚Äústrong suit‚Äù but I know I‚Äôve found khan academy helpful and do think a college environment or an environment where I‚Äôd have the opportunity to study what I‚Äôm learning - rlly study on my own time - would work for me.

I find mental health interesting (there‚Äôs a former‚Ä¶ friend/acquaintance of mine - I say this as we are no longer on good terms since I dated her ex - who has a bunch of childhood trauma and bipolar disorder and was raised by a schizophrenic mom and I remember that even though I ‚Äúknew‚Äù that she was off, I wanted to hang out w her j to observe how she was or how she behaved, if that makes sense.) 

I‚Äôm an introvert and wouldn‚Äôt mind working alone but also feel like a job where I could hypothetically socialize at least a little would probably be healthiest for me. I am more emotional than logical but have heard I seem like both (am good at being both emotional and rational.) I think that I want to help people, even though I‚Äôm not a super-social butterfly type. I can hold a grudge but also be too forgiving. 

I have been into MBTI for years even though I know it‚Äôs arguably pseudo science (I have actually studied the cognitive functions though and feel that there is some truth to it.) People interest me or I want to write about people even though I‚Äôm not ‚Äúgood‚Äù w ppl (I have recently had the urge to write my life experiences.)

I feel like no matter where I go in life, I tend to ‚Äúwork alone‚Äù if that makes sense . For example I graduate from high school this yr and can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve actually made a ton of friends here n it was the same w middle school. I‚Äôll feel nostalgic, but tend to ‚Äúleave it behind.‚Äù I‚Äôve never revisited my elementary school even tho I love elementary school.  

Science intrigues me as I feel that it gives me a better understanding of our world, I know chemistry was my favorite class in 9th grade. I would be interested to learn more abt the human body and different diseases (I was v curious abt aids.) 

Nursing in my state is difficult to get into and I know that programs if you want your bachelors are very impacted. 

I am from a family that is probably low income and my parents may have undiagnosed mental health problems. So that‚Äôs been difficult and will likely be hard since I plan to spend my first years of college of course at home since I‚Äôll be starting at community

I posted a social media poll asking ppl what they think I‚Äôll major in, there are 6 votes ‚Äúnursing‚Äù and 4 votes ‚Äúpsychology‚Äù (and 3 votes, one vote being from an ENTJ who is slightly older than me - in college - who voted ‚Äúengineering.‚Äù)

I was talking to a cute guy (he‚Äôs rumored to be homophobic or I‚Äôve heard this abt him) and got the impression he may ask me out personally (he is an ISTP) but smthn happened that I won‚Äôt clarify. He is conventionally attractive, I get the impression that he found me interesting. 

I posted a social media poll asking if I seem nerdy there are 5 votes ‚Äúyes‚Äù and 4 votes ‚Äúno‚Äù (I posted a few hrs earlier abt how much I love the twilight zone after watching the ep ‚Äúeye of the beholder‚Äù and generally write fanfiction and have actually been wanting to get into Star Trek.)

I have always been very confused about whether I am Ne or Ni because I feel like I have both of these functions, I am very indecisive, I change my opinion very easily because a new idea occurs to me or because I see new information, I draw conclusions and sometimes they end up being true , I have also been right in my predictions [Even in the bad ones] I also have deja vu, what I do have clear is that my other functions are Fe Ti

What do you think her enneagram type is?,hatelife176,1658207628,"My mom will be 50 on August 4th. She is still conventionally attractive w good makeup on, but is now overweight (once mentioned she lost the weight after having me - I am her youngest child - but regained it) so I guess still average looking, especially since we are black. 

She is a ‚Äúhousewife‚Äù but I occasionally joke to myself that in a sense, our family is a deconstruction of the typical American family dynamic. Even though she was conventionally attractive for a long time, my mother still ended up marrying a man who does not make enough money to support the housewife lifestyle, who is emotionally abusive, unintelligent, and most likely an alcoholic (my father.) 

She herself is opinionated but not as intelligent as she believes herself to be (is very against the COVID vaccine to a point where she is letting it impact her ability to find another job - she quit being a social worker due to the vaccine mandate. Yet doesn‚Äôt have any money saved up for if her and my father potentially divorce, and is still w him even though his emotional abuse is definitely part of the reason why her son is presently in rehab and has abused drugs so badly that he doesn‚Äôt behave anywhere near the same as he once did.)

Ever since she quit her job due to the vaccine mandate, our family has had some more financial problems‚Ä¶ but she still rationalizes things as ‚Äúthe vaccine is terrible, it‚Äôs not my fault it‚Äôs the government‚Äôs‚Äù (this is really how she thinks about it.) there was one day last week when I wasn‚Äôt rlly able to eat much at all due to her decision making (as in we j literally did not have enough food in the house‚Ä¶ but if you ask her it‚Äôs still abt the vaccine mandate.) 

I suggested that her hitting my brother makes her a bad parent (her hitting him when he was little) she got angry/annoyed like she tends to and suggested that ‚Äúeveryone was getting their ass best in the 70s and 80s‚Äù (whilst simultaneously being almost somewhat playful but also still having this bad sort of energy she always has when she‚Äôs rlly mad abt smthn.) Though I did notice she seemed somewhat upset last night when I suggested her parenting is largely why her son is in the position he‚Äôs in now 

She used to wear makeup around the house but doesn‚Äôt as often now and doesn‚Äôt rlly leave the house much either. Her parents have both died in the past 7yrs (her mother when I was 10, her father last‚Ä¶ August?) She is below average at this point without it (obviously not Horribly so) 

She was not a great mom to my brother herself, if you can‚Äôt tell. She had abusive parents (well, her father was, her mother moreso sounded too lenient) and was sexually abused and has j never ‚Äúhealed‚Äù from it. She also got into a car accident when younger and I remember was like idk, smthn happened when I was 3 (I think maybe someone assaulted her or smthn? I don‚Äôt remember the specific details but remember she still was a good mom when I was a child anyway.) I remember her accusing my dad of having ‚Äúset her up‚Äù for the incident that happened when I was 3 or smthn when they were arguing 

She does have a sense of humor, I‚Äôd argue she was too lenient w my brother sort of but she a fair amount of the time will tend to blame him more for the way he has turned out 

We live in a primarily white and Asian city still in part due to the fact that she struggles w internalized racism (she wouldn‚Äôt call it that though) but I think it‚Äôs also j bc we‚Äôve never actually had enough money to move anywhere else 

She was trying to be a rapper in when younger (she never finished college and had to get her GED bc there were these girls who were trying to fight her or smthn) and met Tupac once. She‚Äôll sometimes talk abt ppl having tried to fight her multiple times when she was younger but won‚Äôt actually see a therapist 

She smokes weed to ‚Äúde stress.‚Äù I suspect she has undiagnosed depression (she really doesn‚Äôt take good care of her appearance anymore she‚Äôll put on makeup if we go out but there‚Äôs a noticeable differ nice in how she idk presents herself. I do think my brother going to rehab has a lot to do w it)

She‚Äôll occasionally talk abt not conforming to a hive mind mindset or smthn along the lines of that or how you shouldn‚Äôt believe what others want you to but I think or she was raised 

she mentioned she partly ended up w my dad bc she used to be ""crazy"" (throw things, that her grandmother said she was.) I really think it would have been beneficial for her to seek out some kind of psychological help, but w the way my mother is it‚Äôs j obvious at this point that she‚Äôll never do that 

i have a lot of negative feelings toward her and my father. i j think its insane she let my brother turn out the way he did

She is religious but walks around the house swearing anyway, is always telling me to read the Bible

She is still fake a fair amount of the time in dealing w people though even though she‚Äôll also kind of complain abt others being fake

She screamed rlly loudly at me and sort of threw smthn down (not at me just down) a few wks ago when I was upset abt how my concealer wasn‚Äôt actually working. I really sometimes just don‚Äôt like her, I mean I j sat on the ground crying and she still ‚Äúapologized‚Äù but tried to rationalize things like they were sort-of my fault. It was even more annoying bc she kept saying I don‚Äôt need concealer even tho I actually do have p bad eye bags.  

I rlly don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs a good parent or even person and privately feel she likely shouldn‚Äôt have had kids at all. She‚Äôs just problematic.

I've observed that whenever I notice something off with my body, I try to attempt and fix things through but things just become exacerbated and I panic even further. I would say this has to be the worst feeling I've ever experienced in my life because the first thing comes to my mind is that I'm about to die and that there is no escape but just to accept it. Nowadays I'm trying to destress myself from experiencing this rush of anxiety by exercising at least 30 minutes a day and by securing myself to get at least 8 hours of sleep (because I usually only get 5 - 6 hours).


‚Ä¢ Poor Self Care. 

Even as a kid, I never really cared for my body. I never liked sleeping even if my mom forces me to, I brush my teeth once a day on average, I sometimes forget to eat, and even when my bladder is about to explode, for some reason I don't feel the pain whenever my mind's attention is focused on something. To conclude things, I have poor hygiene and I'm only realizing it now how unhealthy things are actually.


‚Ä¢ Feeling Things Are Repetitive and Become Unmotivated.

Sometimes I can't help but realize how boring and repetitive life is, and this notion makes me think that I'll have the exact same experience in the future. This leads me to being feeling burnt out and sad. I try and get into new things but my mind just stops me and thinks that even if you try out something new, in the future I'll end up doing the same thing over an over again and this creates a defeatist pattern about life in general. I wish I could get this off my chest as this gives me the perception to only see life in a bad light and that things will never change.


‚Ä¢ Strong Nostalgia for the Past When Life Right Now is Shit.

I get extremely reminiscent for the past as if I was longing for security and comfort to cope with current problems. I even try and remake something I experienced in the past. I'll use the early months of the lockdown in 2020 as an example. It was the best time in my life so far, not because I was isolated or anything, but because I got to indulge myself with new experiences on the internet. Meeting lots of like-minded people and interacting with them, (this might be a bad thing) I unironically had a superiority complex after spending lots of time reading stuff on the internet and that kinda gave me confidence to talk with people and some of my friends who belittled me, first time learning about MBTI, tried to learn the piano and learning Music Theory and so much more. This was the point in my life where I was at complete bliss and I try and experience those stuff again whenever the the lows in life dawned me. I'd rearrange how my room looked back then, I'd purposely smell some fragrants I smelled to get that feeling of nostalgia, and I'd revisit some of the photos, conversations and games I experienced.


It's not that much, but these are just the things I could see that might correlate with Si as a function tied onto a certain position in the Cognitive Stack.

Type me based on off of my own evaluation and rambling. (Lengthy),its-monday,1658169398,"Hello, anyone reading this post,

I've contemplated my MBTI type for a long time and even began to rethink my enneagram. I am asking anyone to help me figure out my personality type. MBTI, enneagram, and any insight and help would be nice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel conflicted about everything in my life, whether knowing what I want to do with my time, organizing my day-to-day routine, or my favorite subject, to name a few. However, deep down, I do know what I want to do and who I want to be in the future. Yet, I feel unprepared, scared, or ashamed when I have the time to do things. I romanticize and portray a version of myself and my goals outwardly and when introducing myself. But ultimately, I choose to do what I know is expected of me and can only bring myself to do things if they're assigned to me by another person. For example, I've wanted to be a writer since I was a pre-teen. Still, I rarely ever write anymore and instead create three-dimensional characters, interactions, themes, and plots in my mind than physically write them out. But there's so much more to me than just wanting to be an author. I have an education in illustration and enjoy painting and coloring. Analytical psychology gives me more energy than anything, and I could write about it for hours. Other times, I want to act in films or be a political leader. I feel constricted by labels and find great pleasure in activities that combine several ideas. I imagine ways I can merge all my interests in one, and my high expectations are undermined by others, hence me feeling shy about them. I could be characterized as a ""jack of all trades"" but feel more embarrassed about it than proud. My ability to perform well in anything is due to my hypervigilance in directions and structure and my genuine interest in things resulting in my wanting to put in the total effort and show off my knowledge. I value reliability and wish people would see me as that and wise, intelligent, and helpful. 

I worry about sounding egotistical because I know I talk much about myself, such as now. I jokingly think it's because people know themselves best than anyone else, and everyone is their own best friend. Therefore who else would I talk about? I guess I care far too much about what other people think of me because I want someone to believe in me the way my deranged expectations think I can achieve greatness. I consider myself highly reflective and self-aware, but most people can easily say that about themselves too. Sometimes I spiral into the fear of not fulfilling my goals or not being necessary because of how large the human population is and whether I can be individualistic or if I blend in with the rest of my surroundings. The fear of failure and isolation pushes me to ""be better"" despite the unhealthy consequences. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to think I was an INTJ for a while because of my continuous trance-like state of planning my future, having high expectations, and optimizing my chances to succeed above everyone else. Most online tests tell me I'm an INTJ, but they're hardly ever accurate and should be used to confirm findings, trusting the user evaluates themselves honestly (IMO). 

However, this year, I have developed a much stronger Si. So as of right now, I identify with ISTJ 5w6.

I also evaluated myself as a 5w6, but recently, I've been trying to distinguish between enneagram types 5 and 6 because of the confusion I'm facing with my MBTI. I'm still unsure how enneagrams and MBTI types correspond and align.

I didn't realize how present my Si has been since the beginning of my life until this year. But I am conflicted because I know that everyone utilizes more than just the four cognitive functions in the function stack, and some can be equally-ish developed. Some examples I listed before are a strong use of routines and rituals in my daily life, but some seem to be stress coping mechanisms, and others are more natural. I've always been a great rule follower, but that doesn't mean I don't have a strong and defined moral compass that conflicts with the majority (Tertiary Fi, I think.) I also like lists and timing stuff and all that stereotypical bs. But I don't have an excellent memory for details and hardly notice the things physically in front of me. But I do have sensory issues when it comes to textures, temperatures, light, etc. I can't notice physical patterns but love to analyze theoretical and rhetorical patterns, whether reading literature or reading a person. I think that's more Ni than Si, though. 

Honestly, I can write so much more. I've had this internal debate for the past two years, if not more. But if you read all this way, genuinely, thanks, especially if you do reply or read any of this. I'd be happy about anyone's response.

If there are any other types you think I should take a look at, please suggest them! I love reading and educating myself more about MBTI and anything related. 

Also, if there are any more trivial questions to help you analyze, I'm willing to answer to.",mbti
Functional MBTI as a way to figure out career path,broken-pen3,1658169220,"Just had a random concept in my mind and thought I'd share to get some feedback on this.

Disclaimer: This has nothing to do with how people usually use MBTI, this is just the only way I can make sense of MBTI so far and that I am typing myself with. I am also not saying ""X-dominant type = MUST DO THIS JOB OR ELSE"", more so that their thought process more easily fits into anywhere in this industry, but in others they will have to pick and choose ones that better fit their fancy.

Hope you enjoy!

* Thinking-dominant = **Sciences** (More so focused on discerning true/false, backed by experimentation and intuition, with little concern for values.)
* Feeling-dominant = **Humanities** (More so focused on analytically dissecting values and social beliefs, backed by experimentation and intuition, with little concern for scientific method.)
* Sensing-dominant = **Arts and Crafts** (More so focused on creating an exact configuration of materials, scenes, sounds etc. that's pleasurable/stimulating, backed by techniques and values, with little concern for development or timelines.)
* Intuiting-dominant = **Commerce** (More so focused on arguing about the possibilities and potential ahead and what to do about it, backed by techniques and values, with little concern for the current set of materials or resources itself.)
* E/I = more focused on collective approval vs. internal reflection
* J/P = more focused on belief vs. impression
   * T and F as science and humanities are more so about clearly defined and justified beliefs of what is right or wrong, and thus more systematic, immediately useful for clear decision making (AKA. provide judgment) and can be dismissed as too rigid or ""air headed academic""
   * S and N as art and commerce are more so about generally felt sense of what is likely to be true or good, and thus more creative, reliant on case studies (AKA. more data on what used to be true) and can be dismissed as too chaotic or ""anyone can do it""
* AxxB Groups = general idea = Normal Thought Process/Unhealthy Thought Process (Nickname)
   * EJ = collective belief = ""What am I allowed to do?""/""What can I get away with?"" (**Law**)
   * EP = collective impression = ""How do I present this to others?""/""How do I deceive others with this?"" (**Image**)
   * IJ = individual belief = ""What do I think is right in this situation?""/""How do I bully everyone to agree with me?"" (**Opinion**)
   * IP = individual impression = ""How do I show people what I see?""/""How do I keep my worldview indefinitely?"" (**Perspective**)
* Dominant functions:
   * Te = Concerned with what is doable based on the scientific laws (**Implementer**)
   * Fe = Concerned with what is doable based on the social laws like legal laws, cultures (**Diplomat**)
   * Se = Concerned with how to present something in an aesthetically pleasing way (**Showman**)
   * Ne = Concerned with how to present something in a promising, potential-laden way (**Advocate**)

If I don‚Äôt end up single who do you think I‚Äôll end up with?,hatelife176,1658161578,"I‚Äôm an ISFJ.

I‚Äôm a rising senior who plans to start at community and feels like I don‚Äôt have a clear direction in mind of what I‚Äôll be majoring in. 

I know that within the past yr, I‚Äôve intended to take college more ‚Äúseriously‚Äù than high school (I actually took 9th and 10th grade quite seriously due to a desire to start at university but changed my mind due to my struggles w depression and anxiety summer before junior yr, as my mental health had reached a rather bad point.) 

I know that the fields I am considering majoring in are all listed here. 

The one that I am admittedly the least sure abt is probably engineering - it‚Äôs odd, bc I actually think I would enjoy figuring out how things work and am curious abt different systems and what makes things in our world work‚Ä¶ but I dropped Pre Cal in junior yr due to feeling like I never effectively learned algebra 2 well enough during online schooling, so I‚Äôd be ‚Äúbehind‚Äù the typical engineering student. 

Math past I guess addition and that sort of thing is not my ‚Äústrong suit‚Äù but I know I‚Äôve found khan academy helpful and do think a college environment or an environment where I‚Äôd have the opportunity to study what I‚Äôm learning - rlly study on my own time - would work for me.

I find mental health interesting (there‚Äôs a former‚Ä¶ friend/acquaintance of mine - I say this as we are no longer on good terms since I dated her ex - who has a bunch of childhood trauma and bipolar disorder and was raised by a schizophrenic mom and I remember that even though I ‚Äúknew‚Äù that she was off, I wanted to hang out w her j to observe how she was or how she behaved, if that makes sense.) 

I‚Äôm an introvert and wouldn‚Äôt mind working alone but also feel like a job where I could hypothetically socialize at least a little would probably be healthiest for me. I am more emotional than logical but have heard I seem like both (am good at being both emotional and rational.) I think that I want to help people, even though I‚Äôm not a super-social butterfly type. I can hold a grudge but also be too forgiving. 

I have been into MBTI for years even though I know it‚Äôs arguably pseudo science (I have actually studied the cognitive functions though and feel that there is some truth to it.) People interest me or I want to write about people even though I‚Äôm not ‚Äúgood‚Äù w ppl (I have recently had the urge to write my life experiences.)

I feel like no matter where I go in life, I tend to ‚Äúwork alone‚Äù if that makes sense . For example I graduate from high school this yr and can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve actually made a ton of friends here n it was the same w middle school. I‚Äôll feel nostalgic, but tend to ‚Äúleave it behind.‚Äù I‚Äôve never revisited my elementary school even tho I love elementary school.  

Science intrigues me as I feel that it gives me a better understanding of our world, I know chemistry was my favorite class in 9th grade. I would be interested to learn more abt the human body and different diseases (I was v curious abt aids.) 

Nursing in my state is difficult to get into and I know that programs if you want your bachelors are very impacted. 

I am from a family that is probably low income and my parents may have undiagnosed mental health problems. So that‚Äôs been difficult and will likely be hard since I plan to spend my first years of college of course at home since I‚Äôll be starting at community

I posted a social media poll asking ppl what they think I‚Äôll major in, there are 6 votes ‚Äúnursing‚Äù and 4 votes ‚Äúpsychology‚Äù (and 3 votes, one vote being from an ENTJ who is slightly older than me - in college - who voted ‚Äúengineering.‚Äù)

I was talking to a cute guy (he‚Äôs rumored to be homophobic or I‚Äôve heard this abt him) and got the impression he may ask me out personally (he is an ISTP) but smthn happened that I won‚Äôt clarify. He is conventionally attractive, I get the impression that he found me interesting. 

I posted a social media poll asking if I seem nerdy there are 5 votes ‚Äúyes‚Äù and 4 votes ‚Äúno‚Äù (I posted a few hrs earlier abt how much I love the twilight zone after watching the ep ‚Äúeye of the beholder‚Äù and generally write fanfiction and have actually been wanting to get into Star Trek.) I guess I generally like movies 

I am black and probably slightly below average facially but have still had ppl who I guess found me physically attractive I think largely due to my body. City is non black but we‚Äôll see what happens. I don‚Äôt wear makeup yet but had planned to.

My city is white and Asian I guess I find average to above looking black and white guys most attractive my ex is black, I can acknowledge when an Asian guy is objectively attractive but don‚Äôt tend to be attracted to them 

I kind of tend to *want* people to be able to predict what will happen in my life even tho I‚Äôm aware that that‚Äôs not fully possible especially on a social media platform.

I need to do more research on majors and jobs I may want today lol.

How do the functions determine the ways we argue?,LeGall2211,1658157429,"I'm curious if the functions we use kinda determines the ways that we argue with people. I notice certain types using similar ways of arguing with each other and it makes me curious if this is something that would be to do with the types.

I had an argument with my friend the other day and saw how different our ways of arguing really are. She usually just blurts out a lot of stuff trying to back up her argument, mainly using what other people have told her as fact. I usually become really firm and become really stoic and just kinda argue using logic and common sense, though I'm often condescending.

INTP and ENFP relationship,MinaMe30,1658157279,"How do you know that an INTP truly loves you?

So my boyfriend (INTP) and I (ENFP) have been dating for quite a while now and ever since the start of our relationship I began to question his interest in me, due to his way of showing affection. Tbh, I don‚Äòt really get the way he shows love, at least I can‚Äòt really see it.
As an ENFP I tell him how much he means to me everytime we see each other, if not everyday. He seems happy about that, but has a hard time giving compliments or showing love verbally in general. 
I don‚Äòt want to blame him for that, since everyone has a different love language. Its just that I‚Äòd like to know how INTPs show affection, so that it becomes easier for me to feel loved by him.

Does my ENFJ friend trust me since he was vulnerable with me?,Affectionate_Hat494,1658155064,"A while back, my ENFJ friend and I were bored at work.

He didn't go into the details, but he told me about how it got to the point of him having to get a restraining order against the guy.

I don't know if he shares it with a lot of people, but I don't think so. Just given his dynamics with other people, I doubt he's gone into the detail that he's gone with me. But when he told me what happened, I only knew him for about two weeks, so not very much time at all. Do you think he trusted me even then? I know a lot of ENFJs are empaths, or at least have a slight empathic ability. Do you think maybe he could tell even then that he could trust me? Or was he just bored?",mbti

I always get INTP but I think it doesn't really fit me...,Comfortable-Phrase17,1658151915,"Hey, I did many MBTI test on Internet (yes I know it's better to go see a professional) and I always have INTP as a result but I don't always agree with the description... At home I am very bossy with my siblings (even though I'm the younger one...) and I love to tell people what to do. With my group of friends I'm the ""dad friend"". I'm very lazy and messy but when I'm forced to be in a team I'm almost always the leader because I love being the boss. 

At school, I'm very different : I'm very silent, kind and I don't tell people what to do (well not as much as at home). I would say outside of school I'm extroverted and at school I'm more introverted. I'm not shy for sure but it's just that school is a bit boring to me so I don't invest myself in it. I can be at home for like 2 weeks without much problems. I have good grades without much work tbh. And I'm not very good at sports because I don't like that. 

Many people told me that I'm cold because I don't care about their feelings and just want to get the work done. I have a pretty emotionless face all the time but I love to have fun, I'm very sarcastic and  I love controversial and dirty jokes. I love being dramatic (without hurting anyone) just because it make my friends or family laugh. With all of that said I really don't think I look like an INTP but I'd love to hear your opinion!

Survey,EurusZero,1658149211,"Hello! I posted this survey earlier in r/INTP and r/INTJ.

The reason this survey came about was because me and my friends were discussing first loves. It seemed like heterosexual men got caught up on their first loves, but homosexual men in the friend group passed it up. I got curious and decided to make a survey to see what the statistics would show me. I couldn't include every sexuality and I had to cut out gender identity and replace it with sex for the first version of the survey, the second part of the experiment will include more, this is just for prelim findings.

Adolf Hitler-INFJ

Vladimir Lenin-xNTJ 

Joseph Stalin-ISTJ or INTJ. Unsure if he has more Si or Ni but definitely aux. Te 

Josip Broz Tito-ESTP (PDB claims he is ENTJ but I think his Fe is very visible,and his Se is too strong to just be tertiary)

Mao Zedong-ESTP (the 'Great Leap Forward' is what happens when Ti goes a bit too crazy)

Saddam Hussein-ISTJ

Benito Mussolini:ESTP or ESFP,I can see some strong Fi (which would mean ESFP) but I can see him as an Se-Fe loop ESTP too

Kim Il-sung-INTJ

Hideki Tojo-ESTJ (extremely stereotypical Te-Si user,obsessively loyal to past experiences and tradition while untrusting and paranoid about new concepts or unfamiliar ideas,implying undeveloped Ne)

Augusto Pinochet-xSTJ (idk if he had more Fi or Ne)

Kim Jong-il-ISTJ

Francisco Franco-ISFJ 

King Leopold II of Belgium-ENTJ (technically not a dictator but rather a monarch,but the whole Congo colonialism thing was pretty dictator-esque)

Feelers are stupid than Thinkers,Ok_You_7247,1658137357,"Yes it‚Äôs a cold hard fact than Feelers are more stupid than thinkers.

Most Thinkers manage their emotions well without being affected by them. 

Empathy doesn‚Äôt correlates with emotional intelligence. A study confirmed that some of the Psychopaths had very high emotional intelligent than average ; being the types with no empathy.

Thinkers and Feelers can both be emotionally intelligent and have high EQ. Most of the successful feeling types are highly logical as well. 

The most important quality is knowing how to balance Emotions and Logic without being swayed by one of them. The quality to not get affected by negative emotions and process positive.

I know that he is an engineer (I think specifically mechanical engineering) and from my understanding his wife - who Redditors have generally guessed to be an ISFJ - does this too. I‚Äôm p sure he met his wife within that field.

He looks better than his wife in my opinion even though they seem to be in the same age group (he is Asian, I thought she was white when I met her in middle school but realized after looking at pics that she is mixed w Asian, so I guess it‚Äôs fair to say his wife is white passing.) 

He and his wife have 4 kids (there is a fair age gap between their eldest and my acquaintance, the ISFP.) I know that they have a house. 

He has a Facebook account where he has a fair number of posts, it seems he has maybe switched engineering jobs or like the place he works at? He also has an older flickr account from when his 3 younger kids would have been v v young (like babies and toddlers) where he posted his wife sometimes and of course the kids (it has abt 36 pages.) His wife can look sort of uncomfortable in pics but does give off a maternal kind of energy. He posts abt being a ‚Äúfoodie‚Äù to his Instagram and has an account where he posts foods he happens to like. 

He has some pics of I guess motorcycles on his Flickr page and Facebook acc, I remember when I first saw his Facebook I thought he looked ‚Äúcool.‚Äù 

The ISFP ran away from home a few days ago (well, tried to) and was taken back by the police (she posted abt it.) He apparently said having kids was the ‚Äúbiggest mistake of his life‚Äù and also said smthn that I guess made her feel like she was an accident. Either he or his wife called her the ‚Äúproblem child‚Äù (I know whatever his wife said made her feel bad as well) and one of them suggested she is the reason why they always argue. I know the ISFP has issues bc she was r-ped by a group of boys, so it bothered me to know her parents were talking to her like this.

"Do you think that the less people an MBTI sub has (in comparison to their expected number), then the more they are catered to by society and the less they feel misunderstood?",ArmzLDN,1658128482,"As a hypothetical example for clarification.

*‚ÄúIn comparison to their expected number‚Äù means that if 10% of people in the world are ISTPs but only 5% of people on MBTI subs are ISTPs, then ISTPs are half as likely as expected to feel the need to come to an MBTI Reddit as the type on Reddit, whose Reddit proportion matches their population percentage.

As for my dominant function, I am torn between Ni and Te. But I think that I'm worst at using my Se. Because before, I was a very future-oriented person. Just often in my head, planning things or completing tasks. The only time I paid more time to the present is when I learned about ""mindfulness"" and its importance. So I concluded I'm an INTJ.

Do you think I typed myself right?

I'm confused XD,k3n0ps14,1658109946,"First of all, I‚Äôm gonna introduce myself‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a 17 year old from Italy. I‚Äôm an ENTP 8w7 Melancholic-Choleric SLUEI, but I'm not sure about that.

I‚Äôve been reading things on the internet mainly about cognitive functions, but I can‚Äôt understand if I‚Äôm an ENTP or an INTP because of the way tertiaries and inferior functions interact with the dominants and auxiliaries respectively in both cases (I‚Äôm talking about the Ne-Fe loop, the Ti-Si loop, the Si grip and the Fe grip). More specifically‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been in situations in which I could recognize a Ne-Fe loop, but also a Ti-Si loop (and it was stronger). The same with the grips.

Also, the reason why I initially define myself as being an ENTP is because of dominant and auxiliary functions, but I‚Äôm questioning it because I‚Äôm not as optimistic, enthusiastic and impulsive as a ‚Äúcanon‚Äù ENTP.

Ok so, in conclusion, I was thinking about all this and said to myself: Is this problem caused by my weird ass enneagram-B5-temperament stack? Am I just a slightly more introverted ENTP? Or is my teenage brain too unstable to rely on the MBTI paradigm?

Inferior function why are you so complicated?,NightLitchi,1658099485,"(Ok I'll re-ask the question and put it here because on r/MbtiTypeMe it doesn't let me post it for some reason)

‚Ä¢ picky, almost insulting

‚Ä¢ emotive, cry but more about feeling incapable in general/dissatisfied with my life/or more than anything else the ""because nobody loves me"" rather that the latter the majority has I believe, I am often a bit jealous of the people who manage to be appreciate

I‚Äôm an ISFJ 6w5. What do you predict I‚Äôll major in?,hatelife176,1658096875,"I‚Äôm a rising senior who plans to start at community and feels like I don‚Äôt have a clear direction in mind of what I‚Äôll be majoring in. 

I know that within the past yr, I‚Äôve intended to take college more ‚Äúseriously‚Äù than high school (I actually took 9th and 10th grade quite seriously due to a desire to start at university but changed my mind due to my struggles w depression and anxiety summer before junior yr, as my mental health had reached a rather bad point.) 

I know that the fields I am considering majoring in are all listed here. 

The one that I am admittedly the least sure abt is probably engineering - it‚Äôs odd, bc I actually think I would enjoy figuring out how things work and am curious abt different systems and what makes things in our world work‚Ä¶ but I dropped Pre Cal in junior yr due to feeling like I never effectively learned algebra 2 well enough during online schooling, so I‚Äôd be ‚Äúbehind‚Äù the typical engineering student. 

Math past I guess addition and that sort of thing is not my ‚Äústrong suit‚Äù but I know I‚Äôve found khan academy helpful and do think a college environment or an environment where I‚Äôd have the opportunity to study what I‚Äôm learning - rlly study on my own time - would work for me.

I find mental health interesting (there‚Äôs a former‚Ä¶ friend/acquaintance of mine - I say this as we are no longer on good terms since I dated her ex - who has a bunch of childhood trauma and bipolar disorder and was raised by a schizophrenic mom and I remember that even though I ‚Äúknew‚Äù that she was off, I wanted to hang out w her j to observe how she was or how she behaved, if that makes sense.) 

I‚Äôm an introvert and wouldn‚Äôt mind working alone but also feel like a job where I could hypothetically socialize at least a little would probably be healthiest for me. I am more emotional than logical but have heard I seem like both (am good at being both emotional and rational.) I think that I want to help people, even though I‚Äôm not a super-social butterfly type. I can hold a grudge but also be too forgiving. 

I have been into MBTI for years even though I know it‚Äôs arguably pseudo science (I have actually studied the cognitive functions though and feel that there is some truth to it.) People interest me or I want to write about people even though I‚Äôm not ‚Äúgood‚Äù w ppl (I have recently had the urge to write my life experiences.)

I feel like no matter where I go in life, I tend to ‚Äúwork alone‚Äù if that makes sense . For example I graduate from high school this yr and can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve actually made a ton of friends here n it was the same w middle school. I‚Äôll feel nostalgic, but tend to ‚Äúleave it behind.‚Äù I‚Äôve never revisited my elementary school even tho I love elementary school.  

Science intrigues me as I feel that it gives me a better understanding of our world, I know chemistry was my favorite class in 9th grade. I would be interested to learn more abt the human body and different diseases (I was v curious abt aids.) 

Nursing in my state is difficult to get into and I know that programs if you want your bachelors are very impacted. 

I am from a family that is probably low income and my parents may have undiagnosed mental health problems. So that‚Äôs been difficult and will likely be hard since I plan to spend my first years of college of course at home since I‚Äôll be starting at community

I posted a social media poll asking ppl what they think I‚Äôll major in, there are 6 votes ‚Äúnursing‚Äù and 4 votes ‚Äúpsychology‚Äù (and 3 votes, one vote being from an ENTJ who is slightly older than me - in college - who voted ‚Äúengineering.‚Äù)

Last week, I took a photo of his father and well, he insisted that I should send it to B too. B and I never communicate on social media. Never ever. In all these years. This was my first message ever to him.

It took him some hours to see the photos, and some other to reply with some emojis. I was happy to just see his reply lol.

And now, after a week, I noticed that he has blocked me just today. I don't understand why. I didn't send anything after those, he told me in a facetime with my family that he has liked the photos, we don't even communicate that much to make him upset or anything.

Without INFPs social life would collapse,yellowwleaves,1658088964,"At least for introverts.

INFPs are like that one friend who you can relate to for not being as outgoing as others and build the bridge between you and very extroverted people. 

They are that friend who is comfortable being themselves and make you want to be too.

They are that friend who is blended in social circle and when they are gone, something is missing.

Opposing to stereotypes, the ones I've met are assertive people who will speak up for their opinions and values at right places where you end up appreciating it.

I think INFPs are underappreciated and the stereotypes don't do a justice.

Intuitive types can be the most annoying to argue with,ClaudeDixon,1658086283,"(keep in mind I'm specifically talking about the worst kinds of intuitives). I swear the worst arguments I've had have been intuitives. Seems to me that some of them can't answer a simple direct question to save their lives. 

For a hypothetical example, let's say one says I made a fallacy. I could ask ""Quote what part of what I said that fits that fallacy"" and instead they might do something like quote the definition of the fallacy, then vaguely ramble about their interpretation of my overall argument (which would be out of context because they didn't directly quote what I said and address it). Or go on a weird pseudo-intellectual tangent, make incompatible analogies to what I said, and somehow conclude what I said is a fallacy when it doesn't even come close to what the fallacy actually means by definition.",mbti

As the title explains, as a teenager I would enter random debates, and give unsolicited opinions all the time. Like, telling someone their new hairstyle sucks without them asking me, or questioning people on their beliefs when they clearly weren't looking for a debate. I would also kind of be a troll online and was generally a bit... much. 

As I have grown (I am 23 now), I have developed a little TOO much empathy. I suck at telling people no even when I really want to, and I would never insult or provoke people like I did as a teen, BUT I still occasionally make up fake stories online because I like seeing people's responses to hypothetical situations, and I still love debating and discussing ideas. Would this sound like the development of an ENTP? 

I can't picture ENTPS ever becoming pushovers like I did, but I also don't know what other type I could be, since INFJs would probably never have an edgy phase in highschool where they act like I did. Any insight?",mbti

My family dragged me to my sister's beach volleyball tournament.,Simple-Technician-87,1658059578,"So it was hard for me to write this down as the yells of the Se doms around here were too loud. As it was expected I tried using my only connection to the technology world - my phone - and then it happened. It died. The battery died. And I was stuck for the next 5 hours there. So I decided to observe what was so attractive on a sport activity. And then I got bored because I felt like there where like 5 rules that never changed so I decided to observe what the people around me do and are so connected to athletics while I was relating everything to MBTI 

First I approached my ENTJ father. He was silent. Observant. He was watching the match before my sister's one. And I asked him. What are you doing there. He pointed the two girls and he said ""we are going to play with them next week. So I need to understand their play style"". 

Next individual was my ISTP brothaaa. He was looking at some girls and then he approached them and talked to them. 

Finally the protagonist of the story. My ENFJ sister. She and her ESTP duo were preparing for the match. My sis was like yes we can do it and she was always trying to inspire her teamate. 

Moral of the story. I understand that each person can relate differently to a particular activity as long as it gives him some type of benefit. And after all I am back to my beloved PC.",mbti

However, all of this has been happening in the midst of getting divorced, moving, changing jobs and learning to manage a co-parenting relationship - and now that I am more ""settled"" I am starting to re-evaluate a bit. 

I've read countless ""INFPs tend to mistype as INFJs, rarely the other way around""-threads but the more I settle into myself the more I doubt my ""INFP status"". More specifically, as I have gotten some time alone with my own feelings I have realized that I think what I have felt so strongly previously (and thought was Fi) was, in fact, other people's feelings? Because now that I'm getting back into the world after having some time to myself I suddenly find myself being able to ""feel other people's feelings"" - and not really in the mirroring manner INFPs tend to be described as doing. It's extremely useful in my work (I'm a psychiatrist) but also a bit daunting. 

So - can anybody relate to this? Would love to hear any stories you have and also to get any advice you might have that could further help me discern what type I actually am...

So I‚Äôm just talking about alcohol and weed here since I haven‚Äôt tried any other drug. 
But it seems like for me as a INTP, I find alcohol very calming and relaxing, it helps me loosen up, be more social and forget about all the things I‚Äôm thinking about all the time. While weed on the other hand makes me stressed out, I over think about everything and makes me restless, depressed, paranoid and anxious. This is especially the case when it comes to edibles. 
I‚Äôve tried to get into it because my girlfriend who‚Äôs an INFP really enjoys weed and it helps her calm down and be relaxed and also can motivate her to get stuff done like cleaning, homework and other positive things, while I either don‚Äôt feel a thing or it makes me feel bad most of the time.

Observations on intuitive dominants (inferior sensing),New-War1169,1658030277,"So random observation, I've noticed that when intuitive doms interact with people in public especially when they get comfortable to speak freely, I've noticed sensory types getting quite bothered by the way they speak and carry themselves, like they instinctively recognize their inferior sensing function and often intimidate/press them to try and shut them down, even when the intuitive dom is much bigger in physical size.

What do you think his type is?,hatelife176,1658019977,"He‚Äôs someone I‚Äôve posted abt before, and I actually hung out w him for the first time ever today (he‚Äôs the one who I posted abt, the one who is in the group chat w my other friend and I.) People on this sub and Reddit in general I think actually guessed him to be an ENFx when I posted‚Ä¶ but now that I‚Äôve met him in person, what struck me while we were out is that I actually don‚Äôt know what his type is. I know that his ex girlfriend is an ENFP (he mentioned when I asked him that a ‚Äúlot of people‚Äù have had a crush on him, one being the ENFP.) he often tends to like my stories. He is white (I‚Äôm black.) he seemed willing over text to take us to the stranger things convention even tho he didn‚Äôt know me. 

He mentioned he ‚Äúknew a lot of ppl‚Äù back when he was still in high school, to a point where he doesn‚Äôt remember everyone? He was I guess average looking to me j w a lot of acne 

So I remember the first time we started chatting in person - which was today, 3hrs ago - it immediately hit me or smthn I immediately noticed is that he gave off a more introverted vibe than I was expecting? Like almost immediately. His voice was also different than I expected (idk j lower and he has a different tone of voice than I thought he would.) Based on the way he texts, I assumed he would be one of those chatty ppl but he gave off the opposite impression. He still seemed nice though. 

He was able to acknowledge that David Bowie is good looking when I started talking abt how hot I found him in labyrinth, so I imagine he is likely comfortable w his sexuality (he said he is straight.) 

I *assumed* he‚Äôd have a hard time looking at me (I‚Äôm below average to average in the face, but today or more recently def j below average, I look rlly tired and have big bites on my face and need to fill in my eyebrows and my hair looked crazy. But I didn‚Äôt get the impression that he was having a rlly hard time looking at me even tho he wouldn‚Äôt go out of his way to do it.) 

We still had fun - I am most likely an ISFJ and he didn‚Äôt seem bothered by the way I act or my communication style. We talked and walked around, he struck me as being‚Ä¶ ‚Äúmellow‚Äù in a sense? He mentioned he still intends to go into the military and sort of explained that he plans to go into coast guard, didn‚Äôt seem sure abt whether or not he would go to college while there (well like he said he thinks he might, he does plan to go to college. Part of his reasoning for going into the military was that it helps pay for college.)

He ‚Äúknew‚Äù my last name and suggested he wasn‚Äôt sure how he did, that he likely read it in the yearbook. 

He suggested his social skills are still recovering from quarantine and that at the start of 10th grade he would sort of like stutter in conversation. He actually sat down and read my fanfic for a stranger things ship that he and his ex had been talking abt (he said afterward that he loved it and seemed to mean it.)

I suggested I want to be a housewife and explained why (I actually talked a lot but he suggested later on that it didn‚Äôt bother him, his explanation was that he has met ‚Äútalkative‚Äù people and he‚Äôd describe them as talkative bc they talked abt things that he wasn‚Äôt interested in but that I actually talk abt stranger things and school and things he can ‚Äúrelate to.‚Äù) he didn‚Äôt act like me becoming a housewife was this impossible thing when we were talking and I remember I couldn‚Äôt help but think he whole time that he j seemed sort of chill, different than I was expecting but didn‚Äôt give off this like insanely racist vibe this whole time or anything

isfj or intp ?,gomper71,1658002813,"this thread all about me ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I typed myself as an INTP a year ago with 16P on my second try. I always didn‚Äôt identify with the trait that INTPs have terrible social relation skill (inf Fe). Also didn‚Äôt completely resonate with Ti always trying to intellectually understand. I feel like I use Si the most in my life so today I‚Äôm floating that I might be an Si dom. 
I feel like ISFJ can make sense for me because of Fe-Ti axis. Here I may rely on tert Ti to make logical decisions. And Fe to try to be agreeable with others. Before I try to critique someone I try to relate to them. In public I‚Äôm never cold like an INTP may be. At home I‚Äôm a little harsh on my family but just when I‚Äôm stressed. Again maybe thats tert Ti. Also I‚Äôm socially aware of what I shouldn‚Äôt say to people if I know their background. except like a few times I offend people by accident and I feel bad.
I like to daydream about my future and my goals in my freetime. I find it tricky to brainstorm (Ne) but when I do I feel like I‚Äôm in flow so maybe I could be INTP afterall. or maybe thats just further proving inf Ne idk
Also I relate to isfj speech. Found this stuff on PDB:

-Let me know if you need help with anything. 
-Uhhhh, I dunno. What do YOU think? -I'm just happy if you're happy.ü§ó -*fake laughs at joke* ............I don't get it. 
-Want some (insert homemade food item here)? 
-I've got this, really! *internally screams in agony* 
-HEY YOU! BE NICE!!üò° -Ok, be safe! -*short circuits and grinds teeth trying to say NO.* -*sighs and smiles*..........fiiiiine ooookay. behaviors. 

also on PDB I saw a guy named Mr. Knight from Moon Knight who is 1L 2E attitude like me but is an ISFJ and not an INTP. read the comments explaining him and I kin him tbh
also I found out that ISFJs usually get mistyped as INFPs. I typed myself as INFP first try so theres that.

profile on me:
I rely on routine. I adapt my attitudes around different people - like I switch up from clique A to clique B. I like to have a lot of info before I decide something. I find it trippy to change but I can do it if I need to.
My room is usually unorganized, but for what its worth like it after I organize it. I‚Äôm self absorbed. I used to be inactive before the last year and a half. I sorta used to be a picky eater until the last year and a half.",mbti
Is this Ti?,idkkkkq,1658002416,"There's one thing from real life that I considered when typing myself but I'm not sure if it's right: 

When I have to make a decision about something and my parents want to help me make my mind, they sometimes just ask someone ""more qualifaued"" on that thing and then want me to follow what they said.

I don't like this kind of advice, I have to read about the subject myself, and then make a choice. I can ask and listen to what others say about it, but I have to understand why to serioulsy consider it, and I won't make my mind only/mostly based on that. 

That is one of the main reasons why I thought I am rather Ti than Te user, but I don't have very good understanding of cognitive functions so I want to see what will people say here.",mbti
what type does this sound like?,Fragrant-Respond7783,1658000606," ""Their destiny is discovering and dedicating themselves to a sacred calling. There‚Äôs a part of them that‚Äôs extremely complex and layered. They‚Äôre coming to realise they‚Äôre no sellout and aren‚Äôt swayed by what others want. Instead, they‚Äôre discovering how to honour their own code in life by listening to their instincts rather than the thoughts of others. It should become important that their sense of value Isn‚Äôt based on the latest trends or fame, wealth, status. They‚Äôre not like everyone else; their thinking is different from the  mainstream and they‚Äôre intended to live life according to their own rhythms, purpose, and meaning. A part of them is analytical and detail-oriented; they have the capacity to notice everything, set high standards for themselves, and work meticulously to reach their goals. Depending on their environment and life experience, they may or may not naturally follow these impulses. They might relate to this part of themselves, or it might feel impossible and scary to even think they‚Äôre this way. But their greatest potential lies in living their life according to their own integrity. For them to feel truly authentic, aligned and content with themselves, it‚Äôs imperative that they find a calling that feels sacred to them, where money and prestige are irrelevant. The process of doing something they feel born to do must become the priority and focus of their life. They‚Äôre able  to be compassionate, truly empathetic, and finely tuned to what other people need and feel. They‚Äôre discovering their gift is their ability to be a healing force.  
 

They should embrace their Independent, unconventional, introverted side. Learn to feel comfortable spending time alone and in their own space in order to reflect and process. They don‚Äôt need a relationship to know who they are. They likely have a perfectionistic streak and may have a specific process around their work, or a way of doing things that gives order and meaning to their life. If their routine is disturbed, they may feel thrown off and want to fix it. They might be perceived as obsessive or overly critical, but that‚Äôs not how they view it - they just see where things can be improved.  But they should be careful they don‚Äôt go too far to maintain their routines or become a workaholic. If they find themselves obsessing over every detail to a point where nothing makes the cut, then this is a sign they‚Äôre off track. They should let go of compulsive behaviour. They often do things in their own way, but they might have fears around expressing their unique nature or feel pressure to conform, and be like everyone else. In response, they may repress their desire to find a meaningful purpose. They could lower their standards and sell themselves out, pursuing something that isn‚Äôt important to them or hiding their true nature. They might forfeit their integrity, feeling it‚Äôs impossible to do anything that makes a difference. Possibly hating their job, they may become a cog in a wheel and frustrated at every moment. If they find themselves working hard for the wrong reasons, or in an unsatisfying career, they should reevaluate.  


The same can be said for their relationships. If they‚Äôre compromising their needs, lowering their standards, or trying to change their personality to make others happy, they‚Äôre headed in the wrong direction. For their long-term committed partnerships, they‚Äôre learning that to be truly happy they need a partner to satisfy them on all levels: intellectually, emotionally, and physically. Intimacy and sex have to mean something and come from this connection; otherwise, they may be dissatisfied. For them more than others, they need to follow their instincts to feel healthy and satisfied. It would be easy to give in to their fears or pressure and deny who they truly are; Instead, they should quite those voices and embrace their complicated nature. They should immerse themselves in all things that support their life purpose. They‚Äôll feel a deep sense of satisfaction and relief when they‚Äôve found their way - an inner knowing that the direction in which they‚Äôre headed has aligned with what is intended.""",mbti

What Type Does This Sound Like?,Bonzai_Monkey,1657990815,"I will list the cognitive aspects of this individual in order to focus on the actual functions:

* Often seeks to validate their own ideas by comparing them to the ideas of others and seeking direct approval, and often defers to the common consensus. Isn't necessarily afraid to go against what is commonly accepted, but rather, views the absorption of other people's thoughts as a means of efficiently adopting a stance on something they're unfamiliar with
* Views things as logically correct or incorrect, and is perturbed when someone transgresses these views in their actions
* Has a strong *desire* to plan a future that maximizes personal happiness, but struggles to actually do so
* Lots of ideas on what course of action to take (both immediate and long term) but often struggles to pick one, and often second guesses themselves when they actually pick something
* Cares about the success of others, going so far as to constantly try to guide them in their endeavors, regardless of whether or not it was requested
* Struggles to follow routine
* Frequently theorizes on the deeper implications of face-value experiences... an example looking like: saying hello to an acquaintance, and they don't respond, so this person begins to speculate as to what this persons motives might be, and what's going without their observation (relying more on theory than actual observation)
* Has a compulsion to entertain others, and elevate social interactions
* Is constantly pulled *away* from the present moment, and *into* the realm of thought, exploring ideas
* Has an incredibly difficult time figuring out what they personally value and enjoy on a meaningful level, and incorporating that into their long-term goals. For example: this person knows they enjoy certain activities on simple level, like enjoying good food, or playing video games; they struggle in terms of understanding what they *deeply*  and *truly* care about and are passionate about, and structuring a meaningful life
* Has a conscious desire to improve social abilities; wasn't naturally charismatic, but recognizes the importance of social skills and attaches personal self-worth to them
* Most often derives enjoyment more from novelty than from familiarity, although is still prone to nostalgia
* Is afraid of committing to a singular course of action",mbti

My father is a very friendly guy but he was strict and cruel to me. I resent my father after his death but I like to understand him now that I began to act like him. This are his traits.

*Friendly
*Well respected
*Disciplined 
*Likes studying
*Judgemental
*Hates mess
*People pleasing
*Values reputation
*Strict parent
*Grit his teeth during violent scenes
*My ESTJ uncle claims that my father is weak in terms of physical strength after I lift a chunk of log.( He was impressed because I do things alone)
*Vents his frustration to his second cousin after fighting with my INFP mom.
*Many people who knows my father claims that he help them.
*Beats me up for being lazy and failing school.
*Wants me to be successful
*Actually is a loving dad but I don't meet his expectations which frustrates him 
*Doesn't care and claims I deserve it if other people discipline me as a kid.

What is my enneagram type?,hatelife176,1657950899,"I‚Äôm black and have always lived in a mainly non black city, I‚Äôm a rising senior and have been 17 for a few months now. I‚Äôm below average to average facially and seem to remember that idk in middle school my former best friend started insulting my appearance behind my back and that other ppl had before too (used to have a gap between my teeth.) I‚Äôve heard that I have a unique look. 

I‚Äôm not inclined to suggest that I have ‚Äúgood social skills‚Äù - some ppl I‚Äôve met have felt I was smart (I was known for this in middle school) and others haven‚Äôt felt that way. Instead of getting to know people, I honestly tend to try figuring out their personality type or like I‚Äôll make small talk w them and all and come off formal and maybe sort of normal but make small talk w them but I‚Äôll like quietly analyze their behavior or be curious abt their personality type and what led them to be the way they are now.

I deal w depression and anxiety. I am currently interning at a sailing camp and am around a lot of kids, have sort of interacted w the ppl who work there.

I have 649 followers have been blocked by 8 ppl within the last yr (I sorta figured out why but recently it was rlly hurting) and have posted abt the fanfics I‚Äôve written to my social media profile one has 207 kudos. 

I remember that the whole getting blocked and unfollowed by ppl so randomly (it was j 4 in the past week, but one of them was admittedly kind of my fault or rather smthn I should have seen coming even though the guy has never been known for being a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù) was giving me bad anxiety. Like really bad anxiety, crying ‚Äúoh my life is changing‚Äù kind of anxiety even though I honestly had negative feelings toward everyone who blocked me and even though I know that them not communicating w me wasn‚Äôt a great move on their part.

I always feel sort of anxious and feel like I have a lot of trouble w making an effort to idk live a healthy life. I was able to rationalize the blocking today by mentally noting that no one actually ‚Äúknows‚Äù me, even people who think they do, and that when high school ends, even though I‚Äôll feel some nostalgia like I always do w everything, I‚Äôll ultimately likely never visit it again, which is how I was w elementary and middle school. It‚Äôs like I am just ‚Äúpassing through‚Äù in a sense. I wish I had spent more of high school just focused on myself, bc I know that no one really cares abt me like that. 

People are generally inclined to describe me as ambiverted. 

I‚Äôve had 2 ppl who have said they had a crush on me - my ex boyfriend (ISxP) and my friend who suggested when I said I felt 0 had that she did in freshman yr (I notice her best friend now interacts more w my social media profile at least from my like perspective, the girl is white and I knew she was LGBT.)

social norms are kinda confusing.,lamnotmymind,1657948357,"I want to see your opinions on this. Just show me your view on morality. 

For example, I love my dog and everything, and I would never eat other dogs, but why do we condemn those who eat? If dogs are animals just as pigs? You could argue that dogs have a bond with humans, but wouldn't that be a generalization? Since it doesn't apply to every culture? 

Or... I, personally, wouldn't date a cousin. For many reasons. But in some places marrying cousins is normal, and I don't care at all, be very happy. I would understand the part of not dating a sibling for genetic issues, but in the countryside of my country is very common for cousins to date each other and I don't find it weird at all. 

Or, some cultures used to do sacrifices that ended with someone dead. Normally, the person would consent to be given as a sacrifice. Meh, I don't find it weird at all. If the person consented then no one took their freedom.

Those kind of things really bothers me. Like, some day I saw a man preaching the Bible to a woman on the bus, and she answered ""Thank you. I wish that Olorum blesses you too"". The man was very offended, and said that someone blessing you with God's words were different from blessing someone with a pagan divinity. He explained why, but I don't even remember the argument. It just made me realize how naturalized Christianity is in our society, while others religions should be kept in silence. My biology teacher says all the time ""if this isn't God's work, then I don't know what it is"", and I asked myself if it would be different if someone said some African Divinity instead. And yeah, it definitely would. There are so many catholic/christian schools, here but I've never seen any schools from other religions and some people here even get arrested if they put their children (with their consent) under rituals from other religions, even though I was obliged to go to church every fucking Sunday. 

I have some other opinions, but the moral implications on them are so rooted on society that I even feel uncomfortable on saying them, because other people would just disagree with me. Of course, nothing criminal or that violates the human rights haha 

The way they simply created a generalized pattern on what is moral and what is not bothers me very much. Most of the time, these patterns aren't even logical, some people just decided it like that and hey, it's everywhere now. Yeah, even though I live in the western part of the world, the way everything turn around our culture pisses me off very much!",mbti

Tarot court cards + MBTI types. My classification system!,Kiu-Kiu,1657935754,"I'm a huge fan of tarot interpretation mixed with Jungian theories and interpretation. I highly recommend the youtube channel ""Carl Jung Depth Psychology Reading Group"", they have a serie of videos about the subject that is super interesting. Unfortunately I have to strongly disagree with the way most people associate cognitive types with court cards (from what I've seen!). In the end everyone should have their own interpretation of tarot, but in this case I must disagree with something fundamental. Let me explain why.   
  
Both tarot, classic playing cards and the mbti have 4 main categories. Suits for tarot and playing cards, main cognitive functions for mbti (or any other system derived from Jungian theory of personality). And all strongly overlap.  
  


|*Tarot*|*Playing Cards*|*Elements*|*MBTI*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Pentacles|Diamonds|Earth|Sensing|
|Wands|Clubs|Fire|Intuition|
|Swords|Spades|Air|Thinking|
|Cups|Hearts|Water|Feeling|

  
What's the first, main cognitive functions of each type? You've got their suit. IMO everything after this can be up to personal interpretation but in order to be consistent and make sense, this is almost impossible to ignore.   


EX: This is my personal way of making sense of the rest and in a system that makes sense, but it's in no way obligatory. Just food for thought! That's what I use when I interpret the meaning of a court card in someone's spread (and I take their type into account as well)  


Starting from the fact that traditional playing cards have two colors, red and black (usually ""female or male"" but i'll stay with red and black to avoid unecessary gender attribution), I follow along with this logic for the first and second function of each type and then determine which court cards they are associated with. 

For types leading (1st function) with a judging function (Thinking or Feeling):  
Introverts are Knight and Page  
Extraverts are King and Queen  
For types leading (1st function) with a perceiving function (Intuition or Sensing)  
Introverts are King and Queen   
Extraverts are Knight and Page  


If the suit (in traditional decks) associated with the type's 2nd function is:  
Red : It's either Queen or Page  
Black: It's either King or Knight  


Examples:   
ESFJ  
First function is Fe. It's Feeling so it's a Cup. It's extraverted so it's either King or Queen.   
Second function is Si. It's Red because Cups are associated with Diamonds. So it's either Queen or Page.  
Thus we get Queen of Cups.   


ENTJ:  
First function is Ne. It's intuition so it's a Wand. It's extraverted so it's either Queen or Page.   
Second Function is Ti. It's Black because Swords are associated with spades. So it's either King or Knight.   
Thus we get King of Wands.  


So now we get:  


|Type |1st Function|2nd Function|Court Card|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ISTJ|Si (introverted)|Ti (black)|King of Diamonds|
|ISFJ|Si (introverted)|Fe (red)|Queen of Diamonds|
|ESFP|Se (extraverted)|Fi (red)|Page of Diamonds|
|ESTP|Se (extraverted)|Ti (black)|Knight of Diamonds|
|ENTP|Ne (extraverted)|Ti (black)|Knight of Wands|
|ENFP|Ne (extraverted)|Fe (red)|Page of Wands|
|INTJ|Ni (introverted|Te (black)|King of Wands|
|INFJ|Ni (introverted)|Fe (red)|Queen of Wands|
|ISFP|Fi (introverted)|Se (red)|Page of Cups|
|INFP|Fi (introverted)|Ne (black)|Knight of Cups|
|ESFJ|Fe (extraverted)|Si (red)|Queen of Cups|
|ENFJ|Fe (extraverted)|Ni (black)|King of Cups|
|ENTJ|Te (extraverted)|Ni (black)|King of Swords|
|ESTJ|Te (extraverted)|Si (red)|Queen of Swords|
|INTP|Ti (introverted)|Ne (black)|Knight of Swords|
|ISTP|Ti (introverted)|Se (red)|Page of Swords|

  
Briefly...  
Kings: xxTJ   
Queens: xxFJ  
Knights: xxTP  
Pages: xxFP

Someone please help me figure out my MBTI type. Please?,Opposite-Result-1155,1657935086,"There is some of mine charasteristics:

I am a little bit anxious sometime,but anyway i am a really extrovert guy . I like when i can be on the center of my friend company. I like to talk a lot and during the talk i many times gesticulate with my hands. 

I am a very physical person. I like boxing,running,dancing and do other exhausting sports.

I like dark or morbid humor,i usually watch Family Guy, South Park or other tv shows with the same humor. 

I am an incredibly lazy person and the Master of procrastination...Strangely,i like competitions and i always had big ambitions. I can be very busy,if i want to achieve something!

I have a sweet tooth. I was always the slave of my physical desires. If i have i little money i use that to buy to chocolate,cookie or something else.

 My biggest strenghts is the creativity and the writing. Since my childhood i wrote short novels or stories. I also like music(play guitar and singing). But my favourite ways to make some creative things is the painting and the sculpturing. I am a very visual person.

Philosophy,religion and politics sometimes can be really interesting for me,but never on a detailed level.

My favourite subjects in school was history,biology,geography and the literature. My least favourite was mathematics,physics chemistry and IT.

My favourite movie genres: action,comedy and thriller.

Why don't we Use All 32 Types?,NailsAcross,1657933296,"A couple of years ago, I was typing Dave Mustaine using the cognitive functions and concluded that his top functions were Feeling and Sensing, likely Ni, Se.

According to some, Intuition and Sensing are opposites, and Feeling and Thinking are opposites, so they can't be together, and therefore the 16 alternative types that would pair them as primary and secondary functions are invalid.

This seems like an arbitrary rule. 

I've even heard its based on the four elements of philosophy and how the gnostic religions thought he was also researching stated you can't mix fire and earth (N and S) or water and air (F and T). Further, gnostics thought we could reach enlightenment or something by balancing the four elements within ourselves. Jung also writes about balancing the functions, as extremes cause issues, which he covers with examples like Tertullian in his book Psychological Types.

Weirdness aside, is there a better reason than that apparently religious one above, or are there 16 types/Dom+secondary combinations we can now go out and explore? (Intuition+Sensors, Feeling+Thinkers, etc.)",mbti

As an infj, I always had bad experience with entps. I mean, I felt the tension towards them and can say our relationships were different than the ones I had with most of the types but it weren't a good tension. I almost everytime disliked them and didn't feel any romantic attraction at all (even when I did it ened up very bad). Most of the time they turned up being bad and manipulative people. I don't know what those were really thinking about me, did they feel the same as I did? I guess I'll never know because they were hard for me to read tbh.

"My hypothesis for why N and S sometimes struggle to communicate - tell me if this holds any water, or if it's a bad stereotype.",TopTheropod,1657925163,"The way I (an iNtuitive) like to speak is I put forward several things (which are pointless/not worth mentioning on their own), then I conclude with something that ties these things together and suddenly the previously listed things have a reason for having been mentioned. The last part of what I say is what gives the rest of it meaning.

From my experience, some people get that, they anticipate that there's a ""punch line"" (not necessarily a joke), while others take it as a list of separate, independent statements that were put forward. They see the separate things I put forward, but not the point that ties them together.

Could this be an N vs S thing?

Or is it just a matter of some people being smarter than others? I like to think it's the latter because I feel like a reasonably intelligent (even average) sensor should obviously able to understand a point illustrated that way, just like an intuitive.

How to Practically use Personalities,Remnant77714,1657923996,"When it comes to MBTI or psychology lots of people like to talk and it and study it but never actually talk about the practical uses of it. How to actually use what they learn in a practical fashion.

Hence I write this explaining the practical uses of Personalities and Psychology in general. The key is prediction and using that to your advantage, but in order to do this you need three things being:

&amp;#x200B;

1). To understand what the personality is and how it operates!  
2). Learn to spot those personalities in people.  
3). And finally plan your action accordingly to what they are and how you wish for them to react.

&amp;#x200B;

This can be used for multiple things, it can be used to get what you want out of someone OR simply to avoid the pitfalls in social interactions. It could be you are dealing with a dangerous personality thus you should learn to minimize the damage they will cause in your life. Not to mention you can and should use this to maximize good situations and get the best possible interaction out of it.

Knowing what to avoid saying and knowing what the right thing to say/do is key. This is what personalities and psychology teaches us and can be used for.

If you find this useful you may want to check out the more in-depth version of what I am talking about in my video: [https://youtu.be/NgSfkIls104](https://youtu.be/NgSfkIls104)

But in short it is no different than chemistry fundamentally, humans are chemicals(and vary depending on our personalities) and we have different reactions to different things thrown at us depending on our personality. Maybe you wish to avoid explosions, hence keep the water away from the potassium. Or for all I know maybe you want an explosion, thus put them together to get that reaction you desire. The world is your oyster my friend, you decide.",mbti

"Fellow ENTPs, how often do you give off ""ENTJ vibes""",rpd0825,1657922165,"I think this may have more to do with my enneagram than mbti, but for me in situations of competition, I feel like my whole personality changes, and I'm not talking about ""my vibes change so my entire type does.""

Like I consider myself a very strong Ti and Ne user, as well as a good Fe user, but when my mindset shifts to that of managing myself in competition, I feel like my inner logical framework begins to shift away from my own to a more objective and ""people manageable"" one, more so like Te, and my constant brainstorming becomes much more narrowed down into a tunnel vision goal of mine I am trying to achieve, which seems more Ni.

What do you think his type is?,hatelife176,1657918209,"So I actually remember that I had a crush on him in middle school (it was partly on a looks basis - though in hindsight he actually wasn‚Äôt terribly good looking, probably more like average.) Not for the entirety of middle school, but I want to say in either 6th or 7th grade.

I seem to remember that part of the reason why I liked him is bc like idk‚Ä¶ he was an asshole? Like I don‚Äôt know, I know that that sounds weird - like he wasn‚Äôt an ‚Äúasshole-asshole‚Äù who like walked around bullying everyone, but he had this way of talking (I liked to call it a deadpan tone) and we talked when I sat at the same table as him and it‚Äôs hard to explain bc he j had like this sort of weird sense of humor? But he also came off smart at least to me, if I remember right I feel like he said once that he was thinking of going into computer science or engineering or that I heard that once. He was half white half Asian. He didn‚Äôt seem ‚Äúnice‚Äù (but also not like some evil crazy immoral human being) but I remember I rlly liked his deadpan sarcastic sort of sense of humor. It feels like the kind of sense of humor a Redditor might have. When I think of him I get the impression that he seemed like the sort of person who had strong opinions on things, kind of.

He seems like the type that would troll people online. 

Another reason why he stands out to me is bc he dated this girl who I believe is an ENFP (for years) - their relationship started in middle school but wasn‚Äôt over by the time high school started (we‚Äôre rising seniors and my friend suggested it ended ‚Äúa while ago‚Äù though the ENFP still has a pic of them up from like september 2021?) The ENFP was sort of below average to average looking to me in middle school. I remember that *at the time* I felt like he was too nice looking for her and was surprised bc it struck me as being an unusual pairing. They had one of the longest lasting relationships I can think of.

I took a couple enneagram tests and every time the results labeled me as 8w7. In fact, I tried a couple different tests but got the same result every single time. Also, I definitely agreed with most of the stuff that was written about the 8w7 types. 

I got curious and decided to ask how common INTJ 8w7s are in the enneagram server and multiple people responded saying ‚ÄúINTJ 8w7 are just ENTJs.‚Äù I‚Äôve never really been interested in anything other than my own personality tbh so never really thought about ENTJs but once I read about them‚Ä¶ the goods and bads about them really are in line with what I believe in or experience daily.

INTP characters and protagonists,Popkhorne32,1657913131,"Hello, i was thinking about some people who told me that INTP's are poorly suited for main characters in stories, because they are too passive. 
I kind of agree, but i also disagree. The INTP is often the type that is the best to throw into the unknown, like alice in wonderland, because there you get a character willing to explore, who seeks answers, who will enjoy every second of it while still being the relateable average joe who is out of his home and scared.

However, my favorite example would be Yang wen li, in LOGH, who plays deuteragonist to Reinhardt von Lohengram, an INTJ. I thought the opposition was really great and superbly depicts the strenghts and weaknesses of both types.

Do you guys think they don't fit a protagonist's shoes ?

Admire creativity, of course, but seriously, why THINK TOO MUCH?

In my case this is exhausting because my NE is powerful, and don't mistake it for anxiety. I am learning to try to deal with my real life and enjoy the experiences, and if there is any REALISTIC idea I put it into practice, even if it is an idea for an artwork or story I put my hand to work instead of thinking and procrastinating, it's good to live in the present moment (I'm a fan by the way).

I read some books that they left too, and so I lived for them, and even forgot about the outside world because of that, and it grew with me.
My sisters are sensory, and in their case, their parents were more present, and involved them in social situations, MANY situations, which made them have a more focused view on the outside world (something I envy and am trying to improve after so many years).

(Rn I'm a wounded extrovert) 

The thing is when I was 7 years old  (it started often in 3rd and 4th grade mostly) 
I diagnosed with ADHD I don't remember much what I did 
It started often in 3rd grade I struggled finding my Identity more often sometimes I make fun of people a bit not too much so I do less making fun of people but more jokes to impress people I did it because I saw people doing it.

I guess I wanted people to be entertained because I wanted people to laugh I don't really know why... 

Like it's not my fault that no one taught me LIKE LITERALLY NO ONE 
That I don't have to be someone I am not to fit in like no any adult said that untill 2020
Came

Now in 5th grade

When I was in 5th grade I was being someone I am not because I kinda wanted to fit in.. I wouldn't say I'm a gossip person when I was in that grade.. I guess I was just enetertaining people with jokes.. 
I didn't really pay attention much to school work really BC NO ONE LITERALLY NO ONE TOLD ME THAT SCHOOL WORK IS MORE IMPORTANT IN SCHOOL
So instead I pay attention to more talking about jokes

I sometimes realized that nobody likes me

I also told myself starting in 6th grade I would be more mature about myself and stop with the jokes.

When I was in 6th grade
I don't really remember much what happened.. because we did an virtual environment (when covid came)

7th grade
At first in the first month of school I would say I was a mature introvert person that was hard working like an istj was 

But in 2021 
I started being a hardworker but did achieved more work because I was told to do it but I was a bit of a bird reminder good thing I don't do it anymore because someone told me to stop 
 but I still did work in 2022 but lazier so I  turn it in  the wrong day

But later in October and November 2021 i started being imaginative more often like disconnected to the World now 

But when it was in December 2021
I started to think that what would I be like in 2022
I started being a bit worried if I give awkward with my body language near people I started to think a bit what would 2022 be like I guess (well the school year Ig)

2022 (disclaimer all of this is just in 2022)

I struggled finding my identity more 
But I'm still imaginative when I put music on
But I'm more mature not too much mature

- when something doesn't feel comfortable to me what I don't wanna do  (this is just in 2022) I would say no (I still kinda what I want and don't want but this is just depends on my mood) 
-(I still struggle finding my identity) 

-when it comes to uncessary things what people say like jokes, etc  (again this depends on my mood) I became more critical Silently 

-when I'm sad or depressed or don't feel like doing anything then I guess I would do things idk why.. exactly

-but after spending alone at home I still can't understand myself

But after looking at the past (I can't remember much when I was a kid because I had ADHD) 
 I still feel like an extroverted inside me.. but I force myself to be an introvert so I don't do anything unecssary embrassing..
 

If you have any feedback or any questions please tell me 

For some reason it's like I have a memory but I can only remember important memories of myself sometimes dreams when I'm asleep show me.

Developing inferior functions,PsychologicalSun7796,1657892837,"Ok so disclaimer, I‚Äôm not as much an expert on cognitive stacks and what not as some people here. K so on to my point‚Ä¶

I was reading up on Jung‚Äôs theory which mbti is based off, and the way it was explained there was that everyone has their primary function (N, S, T or F) and then the opposite of that will always be their weak spot, while the other two can be equally developed (even if one is preferred). 

So as an ENFP, I‚Äôve always been N first and foremost, been pretty good at balancing logic and emotion though of course I‚Äôm F at the end of the day, and my S side was totally undeveloped.

Well in this book on Jung, it was saying that developing your weakness is what will put you in touch with the collective unconscious and ultimately be your key to a balanced and grounded life. So the last year or so I‚Äôve been working very hard on developing my S. I became friends with some S people, and decided to be openminded (normally I wrote them off and acted like an intellectual snob). They taught me so much and I came to realize that N isn‚Äôt any better than S. So much depth in both. I‚Äôve started training martial arts and it‚Äôs giving me such a high to connect to my body for the first time. I‚Äôve been reading less, and allowing myself to engage in so many past times that I hadn‚Äôt appreciated before.

I feel like it‚Äôs really helped me develop as a person more than anything else. I feel so grounded and more open since. Anyone else has experience with developing their inferior functions?",mbti

Getting mixed results between INTJ and INTP,happycow97,1657886801,"I (25F) have really loved the MBTI since high school, but throughout my life, I‚Äôve received vastly different results, particularly ESTJ and ISFP throughout college. 

I‚Äôm rediscovering my love for MBTI again, and I‚Äôve taken the test multiple times recently, all to different results.  Most often I get INTJ and INTP. 

I‚Äôm a therapist, so this may be surprising, but I tend to approach my client‚Äôs emotions strategically and logically.  While I‚Äôm good at providing emotional support to clients, I‚Äôm terrible doing the same for my friends and especially myself. 

Here is a little of what causes me doubt when considering different types (just went through 16Personalities and found anything questionable): 

INTJ: not particularly driven or innovative at work, hated research in college/grad school, emphasize emotions as well as logic, don‚Äôt choose friends from an intellectual standpoint, love attention

INTP: again hated research in college/grad school, curious about things but only to an extent (e.g. love learning about plane crashes but know nothing about the technical issues behind them), love attention, afraid of upfrontness for fear of hurting feelings, friends have vastly different interests (and I love a good conversation about celebrities), struggle with secretly judging how ‚Äúcool‚Äù someone is, need structure and direction at work

ENFP: Debunking The Stereotypes,JT-Typology,1657886692," \*Note: I have re-written this entry in the series several times. I have strong feelings about ENFP stereotypes, as I am myself an ENFP. I‚Äôll try to keep my arguments from seeming too personal, but if I slip-up, please accept this apology in advance.\*

The caricature of an ENFP depicts a bubbly, frenetic, energetic person who buzzes from moment to moment, constantly engaging with people and finding delight in all manner of excitable ideas and objects. It is not uncommon for people to type those with a rather, \*erm\*, distinct style (dyed hair, lots of piercings) and who have forceful value-based opinions (think of the typical campus activist) as an ENFP. The ENFP, in this stereotype, is incapable of organizing their life, fails to consider the consequences or real-world limitations of their values, and is so obsessed with themselves and their own ideas that they fail to take into consideration the views and ideas of others, instead dismissing them as outside what they have determined is \*right\*. This stereotype doesn‚Äôt align even slightly with my observation of myself and the other ENFPs I‚Äôve met, and I think it comes from a misunderstanding of each of the ENFP‚Äôs functions. Many people seem to mistake ESFPs and ESFJs for ENFPs, and in doing so, they insult all three types. To correct the course on these clich√©s, I‚Äôll break down the stereotypes by analyzing each function axis in the ENFP‚Äôs stack. 

Starting with Ne-Si, I‚Äôve noticed that people are terrible at distinguishing Ne from Se. Many of the stereotypes in the ENFP more accurately pertain to the ESFP (strangely, people are better at distinguishing EXTPs, likely because Ti-Fe is more naturally attuned to typology than Fi-Te). The notion of someone who has a set idea and tries to enact it viscerally in the world‚Äìthe \*activist\* stereotype‚Äìactually aligns with SeFiTeNi. Having a single idea that you view as true and want to make a reality is almost the definition of the SeNi axis. The NeSi axis, in my observation, is unlikely to approach any issue with as much assuredness. In one of his typology videos, John Barnes on YouTube stated that dominant Ne and inferior Si means the ENXP constantly explores ideational and abstract connections and qualities in the world and rarely concretized or internalizes as ‚Äútrue‚Äù any of these intuitive qualities. In my observation, the ENFP, while usually possessing some strong Fi values, is almost always willing to entertain challenging ideas, even if they reject them. Ne never wants to settle on an idea. Ne is disappointed when nothing novel or interesting challenges its Si impressions. It is, in a sense, the opposite of SeNi. This conceptualization of NeSi also challenges some inferior Si stereotypes. Yes, it‚Äôs true that inferior Si can manifest as complete unawareness of the environment, rather, unawareness of one‚Äôs position in the environment (I used to forget to bring my backpack to grade school, for example), but the only distinguishing and important quality of inferior Si is the constant second-guessing of ideas, the notion that a settled idea is a dead and boring idea. ENFPs always want to hear more ideas and perspectives. It‚Äôs for that reason it took me so long to type myself. So Ne gives the ENFP a desire to explore ideas and abstract qualities, and Si manifests as a resistance toward concretizing these ideas as an academic truth. Thus the ENFP often seems frenetic and anxious because they struggle to know what they know, and thus they can struggle to make a decision. A decision means deciding on a path, closing doors, making the infinitude of possibilities one, thus killing infinite ideas. 

Next, FiTe. The most common issue I see here is people mistaking the ESFJs tertiary Ne as the ENFP‚Äôs dominant, and thus they accidentally incorporate Fe into the ENFP stereotype. The clich√© that the ENFP is a hyper-extravert who constantly wants to talk to people and involve themselves in everyone‚Äôs life is, in my experience, not even remotely true. While Fe and Fi both pertain to feeling values and tones, Fe prefers the objective values of the environment. It sacrifices some of itself for the sake of navigating or shifting the objective feeling of the outer world, much like how Te navigates outer logical systems. Fi, the function of the ENFP, pertains to the individual. Don‚Äôt misunderstand me when I call Fi selfish, as I don‚Äôt mean that in a bad way. Fi, when healthy, wants to see individuals happy for being themselves. It doesn't care so much for the objective feeling atmosphere; it cares that people have confidence in being who they are despite the Fe atmosphere. The ENFP does like talking to people who they like, but the ENFP is just as often misanthropic when they‚Äôve seen people‚Äôs individuality crushed, or they have been so many times told they must sacrifice their own sovereignty for an Fe atmosphere. To the ENFP, nobody has a right to impose on an individual. The ENFP has to reconcile their ideal with the facts of the world, which they see in tertiary Te. The ENFP doesn‚Äôt repress Te, so they understand their idealism has consequences and isn‚Äôt always practical, yet the ENFP is often unable to determine how to bring about their ideals. This conflict rages in the ENFP, and if the ENFP isn‚Äôt careful, they can slip into a brooding, dark mentality. I have never encountered an ENFP who is truly extraverted in a behavioral sense, which contrasts the clich√©s. Most ENFPs spend just as much time processing their FiTe conflict and trying to reconcile the truth of the world with the world they want to exist as they do exploring ideas engaging with people. It‚Äôs also worth noting that ENFPs often retreat from people because so few people engage with their intuition. Se is alien to them, and offers no true stimulation. Si is directly opposed to their way of seeing life, so they run from it yet wonder if they should embrace it. In a sense, the ENFP wants to be the extravert they‚Äôre stereotyped as, but most ENFPs don‚Äôt find being that extravert as satisfying as exploring the world of ideas on their own, where they can always keep things interesting.

I've been into MBTI for years now, and tried to get a better grasp of the subject at every given chance, but apparently still can't manage to get a straight answer on my type if my life depended on it. Or better, i can't seem to settle for an answer.  


Long story short, i've tried most tests out there but most seem to rely on some kind of bias. Wether it's the dynamic of the test ('Here's a slider, feel free to move it how you like'), puzzling questions ('If you see a pidgeon flying above your head, can you tell if it's sad or angry?') or asking you for stuff you're unlikely to know ('People usually say X about you', but i can tell you what they say to my face at best).  


Taken this into account, i've tried self-examination and function study. The ONE thing i'm a tad more convinced of, is i'm an Ni dom. But what if i were an extremely unhealthy Si dom? Back to more testing.  


I've consistently got INFJ as a result on Sakirnova, Keys2Cognition, C.S. Joseph's test and all, but is it true or am i subconsciously rigging the tests to TURN out to be INFJ? I've noticed Mistype Investigator being all the hype lately, so i figured i'd give it a shot and... It breaks me even between INFJ and INTJ. Now... I'll agree Fe use is not something i'm not exceptional at, but boy is my Te seeing little use. And a bad one at that.  


Anyways, what would be the best course of action? Is there any final boss of typing you can call and plead an audience with? Should i even bother trying, or just accept that i will never actually know the truth because we don't have enough tools to actually unravel it?",mbti

I think this because I relate heavily to most ISFJ characters (Bilbo baggins, and some other characters from openosychometrics), but I also find that both intuitive functions are stronger on cognitive function tests. 

2. INFJ

ENTJs And Their Story - Success or Trampling?,MrAppleBS,1657829215,"I don't know that many ENTJs (well, they are rare) and I feel as though this is an interesting topic. We hear about how successful xNTJs are with people like Elon Musk (INTJ), Bill Gates and Steve Jobs (both ENTJs), but everyone has to start somewhere and move up the social ladder.

So, do ENTJs have success, wealth and innovation come naturally to them or is it manipulation, trampling on people and trickery? 

I (an INFJ, by the way) will start with the glamorous example. Both xNTJs have ideas come naturally to them, as they want to be independent and be pioneers, leading the world to better ways. Their aims are usually straightforward, but the process is not. 

ENTJs are often said to be natural leaders, knowing how to inspire people, motivate them and have high expectations for work. Wealth or power is usually their aim to achieve high performance. They know how different people work, and apply this to become the game-changing leader, who everyone admires.

However, some can be like a two-edged sword. One side is harmless, and inefficiency slowly turns the sword over until the other side is shown. And that side is not harmless. On the contrary, it is extremely sharp, so much that the juxtaposition is almost unbelievable. 

Inefficiency slows down an ENTJ's plan. The most effective and efficient way to stop this slowing down, which is annoying to them, is to do an INFJ doorslam. They cut out the behaviour that slows down the goal they are working for or they cut out the person causing the behaviour. The most common decision is NOT to give them another chance by cutting the behaviour, and then if they continue, cut them out. They will normally go straight for the second option, as this is more efficient.

I remember seeing an image that reminded me of cutting out a person from a team, and how addictive cutting out people from teams can be. Efficiency is also highly addictive. It was an image of one person in entrepreneur's clothes having just climbed a mountain. The only issue was, that the mountain was made of people. All the people that an ENTJ had cut from a group. 

These 2 are polar opposites, and to some extent both are true for some ENTJs. This will not fit all of them, because everyone is different. 

Some ENTJs will get opportunities and will take them up with calm enthusiasm (if you get what I mean), whereas others will have the potential, but no opportunities. 

The ENTJ mindset of, ""If I can do it, then why can't others?"" is a useful motto for efficiency, but people's capacities are ignored, along with their feelings. 

To wrap it all up, in my not so humble opinion, some of it is dependent on personal experience with ENTJs. However, there is some absolute, unquestionable truth in the question. There will be some success, but trampling for mosr ENTJs is unavoidable. Most of them will consider the emotional impact, but some extremist rational ENTJs won't. This is useful but could be considered immoral. 

For me, I lean slightly towards the trampling side because I understand why they want success and how frustrating it is for people not to keep up. The success is a key part of it though. If there were no success, then ENTJs would have no authority to cut people from teams. Even if they could manipulate people to giving them power, they will know that people will remember this manipulation.

Try to type one of my OC's,00zy3,1657828943,"\- She's a long-time mercenary/bounty hunter/hitwoman (I still need to specify that, but the thing is she murders targeted people for a living). She chose that job because it's one of the most profitable jobs in setting she lives in and she's extremely skilled at it. Despite that, she isn't a sociopath. She does this only for money sake, not for enjoyment.

\- Outside of the job, she lives as a single mother raising a child, who she very deeply cares about. Her current goal is to give her son a happy life and promising future, and one of the ways she wanna do it, is to provide wealth for her house and family needs, hence the killing job. She's generally a laid-back and understanding mother, but still scolds the boy whenever he does or says something bad.

\- Despite her immoral job, she's a very friendly and kind individual in private. Can act selfless and often agrees to help when someone needs her help, but sometimes considers benefits she could gain from this. 

\- Has a lady-like attitude. She always speaks in a polite way and cares about good manners. She's level-headed and soft-spoken to the point, that even when she's mad inside, she can still keep her composure. 

\- She's pragmatic, focused and hard-working.

\- Her way of thinking is pretty old-fashioned. She often makes decisions based on her past experience or sentiments, and greatly values things like tradition and family. Can be sometimes out of touch with current things and trends in society she lives in, but is open to learn new stuff.

\- Her motherly nature makes her sensitive and caring towards children. She absolutely despises them getting hurt, so she never goes after them in her work.

\- She's pretty blunt and straightforward. Isn't afraid to tell what she thinks.

\- Always gets things planned and organized. Usually has some ""Plan B"" under her sleeve, when something goes wrong.

\- Respects elders and superiors.

\- When she lends her money to someone, she ALWAYS makes sure she'll get it back.

\- Works with a partner or group from time to time, but still prefers to act alone.

\- It's very unlikely for her to betray and kill people she considers her friends, unless there's a very good reason to do that. 

\- She's a neat freak, or slightly germaphobic at worst. Hates mess, filth and cleans her own house pretty often. Can freak out at the sight of bug or mouse inside the house.

\- In spite of being one of the bests in her field and being feared by some other hitmans because of that, she doesn't care about fame and success at all.",mbti

Fe-Ti users and individuality?,dame_truthwatcher,1657828581,"Y'all help me explain this. So many times, I'll look through PDB (always a mistake), only for characters that are Fe-Ti users (IMO) being mistyped as Fi-Te types just for having a sense of their own individual tastes and feelings. For instance, Pam from The Office seems like a very clear Fe user to me (she has pretty strong ideas about what is standard etiquette among other things), but many people keep typing her as an xxFP because she sometimes just does things according to her personal tastes (running off to get married at the Falls instead of at the church, running off to art school, etc). To me, these are just behaviors of an Fe user that is attempting to ""take a break"" from stereotypical behavior of the functions in their stack.

I'm unsure of my type.,DragonQueen04391403,1657827347,"I have typed myself as INFJ since I took the 16Personalities test in December. But then I realized that 16Personalities is not one of the most accurate MBTI tests and that MBTI tests are not as accurate as typing yourself or being typed by someone else after studying the cognitive functions. I decided to take other MBTI tests to see what other types I could possibly be, but that just made me more confused. So far, I've gotten pretty much every intuitive type at least once except ENFP and ENTJ. So far I've gotten:

* INFJ (16Personalities, Sakinorva \[2nd time\], Truity, and John's Personality Test \[2nd time\])
* INFP (Keys2Cognition, Michael Caloz \[2nd time\])
* INTP (Mistype Investigator)
* ENFJ (Sakinorva \[1st time\])
* ENTP (Michael Caloz \[1st time\])
* INTJ (John's Personality Type \[1st time\])

I still identify largely with INFJ because I do think that I use quite a bit of Fe, but when I look back at my childhood and adolescence, that Fe didn't always come naturally. I remember when I was younger, there were many times when I would say something rude, insensitive, mean, etc. without understanding that it was rude, insensitive, or mean or considering how people would respond. But when people would get upset with me or call me out, then I would feel bad and apologize. This especially would happen if something didn't make sense to me, which makes me wonder if my Ti is higher than my Fe, or if I'm just very prone to Ni-Ti loops. Then, as I got older, I became more aware of social norms and how to interact socially and am now very sensitive to what people might think or say, especially if they are people that I like or care about.

I am also unsure about whether I am more of a Ni or Ne user. I have enjoyed daydreaming and coming up with different possibilities for stories since I was a child, which I know are not always type-specific traits. I also can be very random sometimes and get random thoughts and ideas in my head. I've had this since I was a child and had a bad habit when I was younger of going off-topic in the middle of a conversation with someone and starting to talk about something that interested me (which could also be my autism and possible ADHD too). Honestly, I'm still a bit confused about the differences between Ni and Ne.

Additionally, I don't know how much Fi I have. I do have some strong values that I am unwilling to compromise on for the most part, but I am also willing to see multiple sides and don't generally like to demonize other viewpoints or beliefs unless I find them deeply harmful and (potentially) dangerous.

And then with Si and Se, I'm not sure. I enjoy having my senses indulged, like playing music, eating tasty food, exercising, doing thrilling activities like going on roller coasters, and visiting new and exciting places. But then I also look to the past quite often and can get quite nostalgic, especially if I'm feeling anxious, depressed, or melancholy.

I hope this is helpful, and I'm willing to give more details if you need them.",mbti

Wouldn't it be better if we would have after every 3 months, 1 week free of school to rest? If something like that would be applied we would have only 9 months of school education and only ~10 months of summer vacation, not 2 whole YEARS.

I could see manipulation tactics in both of them, one of them seemed to be aware of their actions while the other was genuinely unaware. Would melt if you told him, and immediately start course correcting.

I'm recognizing that I've done a lot of hard work to avoid any manipulative behavior, but objectively I think it may be impossible for us to completely irradicate. Which makes me suspect I'm doing things I'm unaware of like ENFP #2 above.

Is there any link with your type and your parents‚Äô types?,InCliss,1657824920,"I have been digging into this and found some stuff on the internet.

Some people are claiming that there is definitely a link and some say that it has to do with 4 temperaments.

For example a Choleric-Sanguine dad (ESTP) and Phlegmatic-Melancholy mother (ISFJ) would result in being able to have all pure temperaments and temperament blends meaning that the children can have any of the 16 types.

Or a Choleric-Phlegmatic dad (ENFJ) and a pure Phlegmatic mother (INFP) can only have children with these types:

Pure Choleric (ENTJ)
Pure Phlegmatic (INFP)
Phlegmatic-Choleric (INTP)
Choleric-Phlegmatic (ENFJ)

This family can‚Äôt have children with sanguine and melancholy temperaments as the parents don‚Äôt have those temperaments according to this idea.

I would have found it to be kinda accurate but there are so many exceptions.

For example my dad is an ENTJ (PureCholeric) and my mom is an ESTJ (Choleric-Melancholy) but Im an ENFJ with choleric-phlegmatic temperament.

"Need your point on view on this, Entj‚Äôs.",Brica98,1657812266,"I‚Äôm an Isfj, considering the theory of 8 functions, my blind spots are Te + Ni.
 I wanna understand if I get the idea of it or not. 

Does Te + Ni, for you Entj, looks like listening to someone speaking while analyzing the affirmations that are made if they are logically correct or not and trying to guess or conclude at the same time the intentions or reasons why that person is talking about it, their end goal ? 

Also being aware of what the person might think at that moment, thanks to the context and infos gathered while talking, and being able to manipulate or use it easily. 

Do you guys also tend to focus on the consequences of an action. Like knowing what is going to happen next intuitively (in my case it can be also based on logic Ti+Ne analyzing the possibilities and verifying the probabilities of them happening with Si).

Intp male wanting to rekindle with female Entp,Confusion_is_there,1657811001,"Hello everyone, male Intp looking for some advice. Basically around year and a half I ended ties with an Entp girl with whom I wished to be more than friends and we were both in it (she was less decisive but it was ok). The reason was that she was trying to go abroad and I feared she might not be as commited and I would be left and replaced (it was rational thinking of me but really paranoid).  She was also talking to another guy and was too people pleasing and that also had a bitter taste. When I placed my reasons she understood and asked if we could at least stay friends and I declined as we I would probably idealise her even more and no change would occur.  So to finish this romantic novel my question is would a possibility of rekindling ever be a good idea, as I wanted to holla at her and ask what is up, cause I saw her today and said hi. We had one brief convo as she wished me a happy birthday and as I started a convo she showed lack of interest and short answers. I would also like to see if things could work, but as I was informed Entps in general move on quick and seek new Ne fertile grounds. I also assume this decision making of mine is questionable and I should have moved on but curiosity apeared all of a sudden. I am perfectly ok with her not wanting anything as time has passed The question is especially directed to Entp ladies.

INFJ door slam...?,XzaAehLu,1657794103,"From what I have gathered, the whole ""door slam"" thing seems to be an Fi thing. Therefore if the INFJ in question is ""door slamming"", judging, ignoring or hating people, that is most likely a demonstration of strong Fi and so the person is most likely an INFP or INTJ, etc. INFJ's Fe seems to keep them open to everyone and likely to forgive or take in anyone.

Zombie apocalypse - MBTI deaths,Beginning_Big4819,1657763039,"This is not based on stereotypes but on cognitive functions so you might find some of them surprising - be open minded

INTP - Potential death : goes on a suicide mission to avenge a loved one or is taken as hostage by another group and gets killed for not cooperating.

INFP -Potential death : Either dies on day one run over by an hysterical mob or outlives everyone around them.  

ISTP - Potential death : might get bitten by a zombie while on a dangerous mission to get important supplies. ISTP will keep going with  the mission even when bitten. 

ISTJ - Potential Death : refuses to run away and follows protocol to defend the place that‚Äôs being overrun. Fights until the end, gets ambushed by a horde of zombies. 

ISFP - Potential Death : Murdered, they get cocky and piss the wrong people off. 

ENFJ - Potential Death : The martyr, they sacrifice their life for the people.  

ESFP - Potential death : freaky accident while trying to escape zombies.

INFJ - Potential death: Just like an INFP either dies first days of apocalypse or if they manage to survive outlives everyone.

INTJ - Potential death : sacrifices themselves to protect someone that was always loyal to them. 

ENTJ : Potential death : dies either of old age or ilness. 

ESTP - Potential death : blows themselves up to kill a horde of zombies, dies smirking. 

ENTP - Suicide mission, when they go they will go BIG, causing damage. Similar to ESTP. 

ISFJ - Potential death : if they survive long enough, they can become real badass. I see them getting murdered eventually by another group, wrong place wrong time.",mbti

Would over-using shadow functions cause any negative effects?,Anxious_Pet,1657754593,"Hi, this is my first post on reddit. I've been here for a while as a reader, but now I decided it would be fun to ask my own questions and participate in the discussions. I'm sorry if post this somehow incorrectly.

I have a question regarding shadow functions and what happens when we use them too much. I am still trying to understand functions in general. So we all have the four main functions, and from what I understand, we feel best when we use the dominant and/or auxiliary functions. With age we develop the tertiary and inferior functions more, but, in general, resorting to those can be unhealthy - we speak about ""grips"" of functions which usually occur when we are stressed, depressed, overwhelmed etc. But still, the tertiary and inferior function can have positive effect on us if developed - since they are also called relief and aspirational.   


But what about the rest of the functions in our stack? Even though we use mostly the four main ones, we still have the other four. Since we all have also the nemesis, critical, trickster and demon - how does using these influence us? If one can be in an unhealthy grip of their inferior function, is resorting to the four shadow functions (which are even lower in the stack) for too long also unhealthy? To give this more context, INFP has Se as the Deceiving function. If INFP is forced to use Se for too long, would it cause any negative effects, like feeling mentally drained, detatched, annoyed or depressed? What about the other shadow functions? Have any of you noticed any negative side effects of using your shadow processes for too long, without the possibility to resort to your higher functions?",mbti

Could Personality Type Influence Political Opinion?,KannasHyper,1657743588,"I feel like certain personality types have a tendency to stick to certain political or economic beliefs. I'm sure a lot of it has to be because of other factors, but even between people of differing political opinions, I still see certain trends of how conservative or progressive they are or the level of extremism they maintain.

I notice that feeling dominant personality types have a tendency to favor socialism or communism, and tend to be more progressive in general. Whereas Te personalities seem to more favor capitalism, especially the ESTJ and ENTJ.

The oddest pair to me is the INFJ and INTJ, which seem to be distinctly different from how I would think they should be according to this theory. Despite having Fe, INFJ's seem to be much more conservative than other personality types around them, and INTJ's the opposite. Speaking to INTJ's they seem to be rather progressive compared to other personality types, even other feeling dominants.

I don't have much experience interacting with sensors, but the sensors I have met are Te or feeling doms, and they seem to fit the mold. I'm interested to see if anyone has noticed anything similar, or if anyone could expend or critique my theory. Thanks for reading!",mbti

"I have trouble figuring out my MBTI, could someone type me?",julsenz,1657728475,"I have been interested in typology for about 2 years now. I have identified myself as INFP, INTP (for the longest), ENFJ, INFJ, ISFP, ESTP, ENTP and ENFP. I know, its quite alot.
My problem is rather weird i would say. Its like I keep changing my personality whenever Im bored of it, or if its not ""special"" enough. For example, a few months ago I have identified myself as INFP. I suddenly decided that its not for me. Why? Because there are loads of INFP's on tik tok. Thats a really stupid reason I know üíÄ But at that time i felt like Im pretty common, not special and boring (dont get me wrong i love INFP's) and at that moment i was really unhappy with myself and clearly not satisfied anytime i would get INFP on a personality test.

I know MBTI tests are not really corrent and the best way to find out whats my type is by cognitive functions. Though it seems I have trouble with that too..

Also, on most of the tests ive done the answers were really confusing because i got 80% intuitive and 20% sensing and 50/50 on the rest. I could also say that Im not really a sensing person. 


So could someone please type me?
I know my enneagram is 2w3 and my tritype is 279 which doesnt really change.


Here are some things about me:

- I am very creative. I quickly think about ideas and ways of doing things, people often tell me that I have my head in clouds.

- With my FRIENDS I talk alot. Like really alot. Im usually the first person to answer when a question is asked. Of course Im also a great listener, but if you ask some people, they would say i keep the conversation going. I also often get told that Im super funny and always know what to say to make them feel better. When I asked them they told me im 100% an extrovert. 

- With my FAMILY Im not that talkative. I often just listen to their conversations and talk when I have to or when Im asked something. Sometimes they call me quiet or even shy (Im not shy I just dont like talking with them because they always turn it into not funny teasing üòø). I asked them and they say im really introverted. 

- If i had to decide on if im introverted or extroverted i would say im an introverted extrovert. Idk if that helps üò≠

- I start a lot of tasks or plans but usually finish only few. I get bored really easily.

- Im impatient, I hate routines.

- I make decisions quickly but then I think about them and worry that i chose wrong.

- I have been the best in my studies all my life, i won alot of ""best student"" awards, and with my friends opinions i could say i bring logic into alot of things, but i know when to relax. I also like testing my mind with things like criminal cases and trying to figure them out one by one.

- I always try to include everyone when working in a group. Even though harmony with everyone is important i think the most important thing is finishing the task we were given. I can seem bossy and rude if someone doesnt work together or simply doesnt care, and bothers everyone else.

- I dont see myself as a leader, my friends say so too.  Even though I seem like a leading type and Im really good at it, I prefer just doing my task and communicating with other people while finishing it and helping them. 

- I put others needs before my own. I often get told im naive and get used, I also have trust issues.

- I feel satisfied when having aesthetic and beautiful things around me. Makes me feel at peace.

- I dislike competitions, Id rather work in a group.

- Im not really organized, my room is super messy but at least i know where everything is.

- I plan alot of things but i hate having to-do lists.
I have my whole future planned out.

- i dont like going out that much, but im way more energized when spending time with my friends. When im alone i feel like i dont have a purpose, but it makes me more relaxed.

- Im very objective.

- People tell me im an expert in everything and come to me for advices. Sometimes i just know things.

- I like risky situations, even tho sometimes they make me sick to my stomach, i really enjoy the excitement.

- i REALLY value peoples opinion about me. I may seem obsessed with my appearance, but in realjty i just dont want to make a fool out of myself.

- Im really kind and warm with people, mean but in a funny way.

- i like being in the center of attention but not for long. if people look at me too much i get really nervous. performing on a stage, like reciting something or singing, isnt really a problem for me. 

- very responsible when it comes to work.

- i dont feel good with myself when im not good at something even tho its my first time doing it.

- i spend ALOT of time on social media.

- I love to help

- im kinda outgoing, but like i said i care about people opinions so in some situations i may appear shy

- rather chaotic

What top tips would you share someone who has difficulty typing themselves?,thatkillsme,1657724823,"1. Stop taking personality tests/quizzes to try and confirm your true type. Stop. Just stop.  All variations of the tests/quizzes basically suck (N is about deep thought, E is about sociability, J is about organization ... what). You're only going to cause yourself anxiety when you get different result(s) each time. Taking a cognitive function one /might/ help with narrowing down some possible functions as an initial consideration, but the bulk of the work will be reading up on cognitive functions.

2. If you're having trouble with identifying your dominant function, try to see if you can identify your inferior. The reason why it can be difficult to realize your dominant is because you basically live in breathe that way, it comes so naturally and instinctive to you, you might not realize you've been operating that way the whole time. Your inferior function, is going to be the one most people will be a struggle point since it's constantly trying to counter - balance with your natural state,  your dominant function. 

3. Cognitive functions =/= behavioral patterns. While it is true that someone's behavioral patterns can sometimes correlate with cognitive functions, it's a completely reductionist approach and you'll basically fall back to stereotypes. Think about it -- It is common to say that Si is about details and memory; but if that were true, that would mean Se types have little/none memory. think about that for a second.

4. If you're having trouble differentiating the introverted/Extraverted counterparts in cognitive functions, instead of reading the cafeteria buffet descriptions of Cognitive functions to try to differentiate the two, change your framework/approach to understanding that the key difference is how the subject (self) relates or orients relative to the object (not the self, aka whatever the self is interacting with in the external world). Introverted (subjective) functions will prioritize and favor the self, suppressing the objective factor; whereas, Extraverted (objective) functions will suppress the self in favor the object's external influence.

ESTJ: Debunking The Stereotypes,JT-Typology,1657711254,"This will be a long post. Of all the types, the typology community assigns to the ESTJ the most numerous and demeaning stereotypes. Perhaps because the ESTJ is unlikely to take an interest in typology, few interact with the community, and therefore the community only glimpses the surface of the ESTJ. Rarely do people actually dive into what makes the ESTJ an ESTJ, and even more rarely do people try to understand *why* the ESTJ might behave the way they do. I hope to ""redeem"" the ESTJ insofar as their image needs redemption among the typology community and illustrate how the well-developed ESTJ is not only well-meaning, but seeks to use the lessons they have learned to help others. 

The ESTJ is often depicted as an unyielding disciplinarian, never allowing a toe out of line, enforcing rules and minutia for the sake of minutia. Unlike the ENTJ, who is at least credited with having an intuitive vision, the ESTJ is clich√©d as a concervative enforcer, an abusive police officer, a sadistic drill sergeant. Worst of all, the ESTJ has, according to the stereotype, no morals or ethics. What they know and like is right, and everyone else will just have to deal with it. 

This picture of the ESTJ is, frankly, insulting. Though I'm not an ESTJ myself, I can imagine how such pigeonholing of a type would be infuriating. 

Without further ado, the breakdown:

Regarding the stereotype that ESTJs are unyielding disciplinarians, I think people miss a blatent fact: The ESTJ doesn't repress intuition at all. In fact, they have tertiary Ne. Just as the INFP can seem Si heavy or the IXTJs have very personal and noticeable Fi values motivating them, the ESTJ loves to play with ideas. In fact, most ESTJs I've encountered are very open minded in that they're willing to entertain a reasonable argument so long as it has some application to their primary TeSi proclivity. Speaking of TeSi, because people misunderstand dominant and auxilary Si so severely, they tend to put too much emphasis on an unfair interpretation of it. Just as the ISTJ seeks an Si sense of concrete reality as understood through the Ti execution of Fi goals, the ESTJ seeks to execute (Te) their idea of what is good (Fi) using Si as their perceptive tool for doing so. To the ESTJ, enforcing Te structure is not limiting or evil because doing so ensures the most important and fundamental Fi ideals are upheld consistently. Just as the ISTJ seeks to prevent chaos that could disrupt Fi, the ESTJ seeks to reign in the chaos. The reason the ESTJ can seem so impersonal or harsh is because they have Fi inferior, so while they have a motivating sense of what is right, they often struggle to focus on individuality, despite wanting to help individuals. They support individually insofar as it doesn't break the bounds of their Te, but if you do break the structure of Te, you incurr their wrath because you might hurt the individual, as the TeSi structure exists to allow individuals to live the best lives possible within the confines necessary as dictated by the concrete realities of our world. (Sorry if that was a bit abstruse.) 

As for the notion that the ESTJ is a less creative or visionary ENTJ, it fails to understand how SiNe works. SiNe exists to concretize and explore. In the ESTJ, concretization takes priority, but exploration and experimentation still constantly influence. Whereas the ENTJ sees the world for objective sensory reality and from that reality sets itself upon *the possibility*, the ESTJ sees many options and possibilities and concretizes as *true reality* those possibilities which conform to their subjective sense of reality. Whereas the ENTJ seeks to tame the chaos of the moment into a single vision, the ESTJ seeks to tame the chaos of many moments into a unified and structured moment. 

In conclusion, though the ESTJ often seems like a harsh disciplinarian, usually this persona stems from a desire to force stability into reality, and the ESTJ sees themselves as fighting back the chaos that threatens to hurt a world of individuals. Since we all, according to TeFi, exist as indivuals and wish to continue doing so, we must all build and maintain the levies which hold back the ocean. Those who don't pull their weight or refuse to recognize the real-world consequences of complete focus on their personal values and identity endanger others' ability to be individuals to the degree concrete reality permits. There are, unfortunately, facts of existence, and we can't ignore those facts in the face of idealism, lest our ability to find meaning in our own existences is washed to the untamed realm of chaos. 

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for the ENFP write-up! It might take a while, as I'm still mulling over how I wish to present what I mean to communicate about the ENFP.

Can someone help me discern?,Beach-Bionic123,1657696325,"I took the MBTI personality test twice in my life now (from Typology Central and possibly a couple other sites) and I got ENTP the first time and INTP the second.

Consider the MBTI to be a waste of time and pointless in terms of its potential applications? READ THIS in order to gain some proper perspective.,RahLord666,1657691795,"**MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SENTENCE HAS THAT ""CLICK"" (IF NOT READ IT OVER AGAIN)** ***Lazy Bum*** **lol**

**ALSO! I promise you will see the light at the end of the tunnel (or at least have some sort of comprehension) with my guarantee.**

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality test that asks respondents a series of questions designed to reveal their dominant personality style. Its scientific accuracy and reliability have been questioned by academic psychologists, but the instrument has found widespread use in business settings. *Although most people agree that Jung's type categories do correspond to some real-world differences in personality, the MBTI is not considered to be a scientifically reliable measure of these types.*

Given that each of Jung's personality types is based on a person's way of thinking, it stands to reason that mental processes are more indicative of one's true personality type than outward actions. Your behavior is the outward manifestation of your thoughts and how you interpret the world, or your cognition. Direct questions about one's cognition are preferable when conducting a type assessment, while questions about one's behavior are, at best, only useful for inferring one's cognition.

*The issue with stereotypical views is not so much that they are ""incorrect,"" but rather that they provide a very restricted vision of what each kind can be.* For instance, it is not altogether incorrect to state that people with¬†Ne as the DOM function¬†are disorganized because it is in the nature of Ne to generate new ideas. Similarly, it is not entirely incorrect to say that people with the Se DOM lead-function are impulsive because they are frequently quick to act, etc. It is problematic to utilize stereotypes in any of the following ways: 1) to criticize, condemn, or disparage an entire group; 2) to legitimize harsh judgments or prejudices against individuals; and 3) to cause individuals to be unable to reach self-acceptance.

It is true that becoming familiar with your personality type is an effective means of determining your areas of weakness. It is impossible to make significant progress, however, if you do not first learn to accept yourself and to view yourself in a realistic manner. This is a process that can be hampered by the feelings of self-loathing that are occasionally produced as a result of unfavorable stereotypes. This can also work the other way around, with a person being able to hide behind positive stereotypes and create excuses for their shortcomings in the process.

The most harmful and upsetting generalizations are frequently those that are held by people of opposite personality types. When your own functions are poorly developed, particularly in the lower regions of the stack, you don't comprehend them very well. As a result, this can severely affect how you see and judge people who have those functions higher in the stack. This is how we obtain things like the frequently mentioned ""intuitive bias,"" in which type descriptions favor N and implicitly disparage S since they are authored by Ns

While it's true that popular stereotypes often accurately portray some members of a given group, this in no way holds true for everyone who identifies with that group as a whole. Therefore, depending on stereotypes to understand others is intellectually lazy and will definitely cause conflict in your relationships because no one likes to be pigeonholed (I've seen people say things like ""I would never date a person of this type or that type"").

What's missing here is the nuance that, yes, stereotypes can sometimes be accurate descriptions of you. When I watch people who share my traits participating in particular activities, I can understand them perfectly even if I choose not to engage in them myself. Would you say the stereotype is ""correct"" or ""wrong"" in my situation if I told you that I am easily capable of engaging in a certain behavior but I choose not to engage in that conduct (for whatever reason)? I can relate to a stereotype since I know that I am capable of acting in the same way myself. To my knowledge, that is not the right thing to ask.

Learning the tools to effectively and uniquely express one's true self is the fundamental goal of learning type theory. The cognitive processes themselves are neutral and do not have any good or bad implications; rather, the good and bad meanings result from how a person chooses to use their cognitive abilities. **Don't be a dumb automaton of your innate personality type; instead, exercise the free will you've been given to act in ways that are consistent with, or at odds with, your type.** Whether you want to be an exemplary, average, or repulsive representation of your type is a choice you must make for yourself. ***The value of stereotypes is that they serve as constant reminders of this.***

**Can a majority of people define the term ""logic""? Because it incorrectly conflates ideas like cognition, emotion, morality, and intelligence, it should be eliminated from MBTI descriptions.** *Deduction of a conclusion from premises according to a predetermined set of rules is what logic is all about, to put it briefly.* True or false? Absolutely everyone does that. Everyone employs logic, but only a fraction of them use it effectively because they are unaware of the process and how it works. The ability to use logic effectively is a taught skill, much like the ability to use other types of critical reasoning. ***Anyone can use logic to generate conclusions that are incorrect or misleading, or, to use the more technical term, are perfectly valid logically but ultimately unsound. However, when individuals use the term ""illogical"" in common speech, they are generally trying to call someone out or make an unfair ad hominem judgment about the person's IQ.*** If you disagree with someone's conclusion and think it's wrong, that doesn't mean they aren't using logic; it just means they're not using logic in the way you'd expect, due to their employing a different set of rules or premises.

**Here we bring in the theory of cognitive function.**

Which of the two conclusions do you think is the ""more logical"" one? This is not the correct question to ask because moral philosophers and ethicists are the ones who should be asking it; type enthusiasts aren't the ones who should be asking it. Typology merely sheds light on the facts of how different people come to different conclusions; typology should not make value judgments that run the risk of saying a certain cognitive function is advantageous to the others when, in reality, they are all necessary and each one has something valuable to contribute to the reasoning process depending on the circumstances.

**Typology should simply illuminate the facts of how different people come to different conclusions.** Which of the following conclusions is the most appropriate one to pick? Because it does not take into account the wellbeing of humans, the T conclusion faces the risk of arriving at solutions that are harsh. As a result of failing to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the efficacy of the activity, the F conclusion runs the risk of coming up with solutions that are either insufficient or unintentionally harmful. Every cognitive function has its own particular areas of concentration as well as blind spots.

People should, ideally, consider information gained from all four of their cognitive processes before making a choice. If they don't, they run the risk of making errors in judgment due to the appearance of blind spots.

This is the risk that comes with interpreting MBTI: people who write about MBTI are intrinsically biased because of their own type blindness to the functions that are ""foreign"" to them, and as a result, a great deal of information regarding MBTI is faulty, misleading, and stereotyped. E.g. Because you are judging people based on the standards of your type rather than the standards of their type, people of type X have a tendency to view the reasoning process of people of type Y as ""illogical."" This is because people of type X judge others according to the standards of their own type rather than the standards of the other type.

According to cognitive function theory, each personality type as well as every individual have their very own one-of-a-kind way of thinking. As a result, in order to genuinely understand typology in an appropriate manner, an individual must first overcome their own implicit ""typism."" The theory of functions explains how your mental processes work when you are trying to understand the world and make decisions about it. It is not an issue of whether you are ""logical"" because everyone uses logic when making judgments; rather, what matters is the set of criteria and premises that you use when drawing conclusions. **This is what determines your type.** Because the Thinking and Feeling cognitive processes use distinct and usually contradictory criteria for arriving at conclusions, this frequently results in disagreements between individuals who are unable to comprehend or reconcile the line of thinking held by the other person.",mbti

Need help figuring out my type.,youkidmecat,1657676482,"I believe that I have an introverted function as my dominant since I'm more energized spending time alone and I can spend the majority of time talking to nobody. I already know that I'm a Te-Fi user because I'm more of a goal-oriented person and I need to have a goal in mind when working toward something, and I find Ti descriptions about all this internal framework very confusing. I'm not very talkative, although I'd say I'm a confident person. Usually I feel awkward when people do something nice for me or thank me and such, so that rules out Fe. 

For sensing though, I'm not sure if I understand Si right. Descriptions often mention Si as a function that gathers information from their memories. From my understanding, Si users subconsciously compare their experiences to stored memories when they do something? I don't usually think about my past unless I choose to do so, and I don't have vivid memories. Then does that mean I have Se?

Now this is the hardest one for me, Ne and Ni. The tricky part is I'm an artist, so how do I know if I'm using Ne or Ni? I imagine things and take inspiration from everything I see. There's no way I can tell. But if I don't really have Si then another function can only be Ni, although I already know I can't be ENTJ. So the only one left is INTJ and Ni would be my dominant function, but I don't even know what Ni is. Surely everyone has imagination and is capable of making assumptions about things that don't exist or things that they don't know about, right? Do non-Ni users not make judgements about things they barely know about at all? I don't understand... For example, I watched a Youtube video but it's so long I didn't want to spend time watching all of it, so I scrolled down to read comments and I knew right away what the video was about. Is this what introverted intuition is? Is this not supposed to be normal for everyone?",mbti

Type my pal,powderofsmecklers,1657666971,"Right, so myself and my friend are both pretty high, listening to music, chatting shit and all that jazz. He's very much written off the MBTI as ""corporate astrology"" (probably from being asked by colleagues to take the 16 Personalities test -;in which, he tested as ESTJ). Now I think I've got a preeeety  good idea of his personality and his cognitive functions. Of course, he writes it off as horseshit. But, in the name of winding the guy up, I want to see if y'all are on the same page as me. So, I'll give you a bit of a gist and I'll edit later with what type I think he is (obv I can't read his decision making processes but, hey, bit o' fun right?).

- Smart. A tricky bastard. In a very sort of political way - we watch debates and leadership races and mess around trying to argue positions that neither of us genuinely advocate. Purely because it's fun to get the last word. 

- Empathetic. He's passionate about class inequality...even though he's grown up with parents working in management and engineering roles. He has no personal reason to support these people, he's well off. His job provides him with health and dental care etc. It's the principle for him. 

- Holds back his emotions. He went for about 4 years without telling a girl who he clearly liked (and the rest of us could see it) that he was into her. Later admitted he was devastated when she got engaged. While drunk, of course, hasn't spoken of it since. 

- Multiple interests. History, politics, existential philosophy, natural sciences (extremely clued up on zoology/entomology and geology) and music - from Chopin to Beatie Boys. But...nothing holds his interest for long enough to forge a career out of. Dude has a new 'thing' every two weeks. 

- Outgoing. Can make friends wherever he goes. Manages to strike up conversations with all sorts of people in all sorts of environments and situations. Even if he ends up pissing them off,  he manages to never truly offend them. Charming, I suppose. However, he's very independent and likes his home life to be his own. 

- Lazy. It's undeniable really. He's lazier than me, an ENTP. He'll sleep in but always have an excuse - even when his mother rings him from 300 miles away (in the UK, that's a lot). ""Tell you what, this arseholes postman INSISTED the parcel was meant four no.10 and refused to believe it was misdelivered""). Panics last minute for work projects but always gets a good review. 

- Lastly (for now), he's kind of a prick...in most people's eyes. His sense of humour is very dark. I get it, myself, but a lot of people don't and he puts his foot in it a lot. But, most people can tell he's messing about and it does not represent his views. I get an opposite reaction, normally. And probably cos I'm a woman but, hey, that's a discussion for a diff thread.

**Things I adore about ENTJs:** 

*üíñ Your honesty and determination inspires me to be unapologetically myself. Sure, I was honest and individualistic, to begin with, but being with an ENTJ made me fearless, even. Now, I do not feel the need to be sheepish with the truth.* 

*üíñ You help me rationalise* ***some*** *issues. It may not always work since I am super emotional and can get overwhelmed, but it works. Even to the point of telling my ENTJ to not worry about a callback since it is irrational and ""the call won't happen faster if you worry.""* 

*üíñ Your expectations for yourself and your innate drive are a wonderful way to feel motivated for anything in life, really. My standards are higher as a result, and I feel more demanding of myself and people (in a healthy way).* 

*üíñ Although you are stereotyped as some sort of antagonistic strategist, being close to an ENTJ showed me the opposite. You are deeply affectionate, caring, and protective when you are close to someone. My ENTJ always hypes me up when I feel down, reminding me of my strengths in a rational way.* 

*üíñ You genuinely love people. And talking. Just like me. So we end up talking for hours, sometimes unwillingly interrupting one another. No matter how much we talk, though, we never run out of topics to discuss. We can laugh, we can argue, we can discuss, we can even cry together, and every single conversation with you leaves me fulfilled.*

Is my way of thinking related to a mbti type?,bearlife2020,1657657000,"
Im wondering if how I think and process information is either normal or at least healthy or problematic and if it‚Äôs related to a mbti type. 

The way my brain works is that I follow an internal set of rules when making decisions and as a result, i don‚Äôt think about how my actions affect other people, because I‚Äôve thought about it ahead of time when making the guidelines and rules ahead of time.

So for example, I don‚Äôt need to think of how cheating on a girlfriend would make her feel, because I‚Äôve already thought about it and know it‚Äôs a shitty thing thing to do. So I‚Äôve made it a black and white rule on my head that I‚Äôll just never break. I don‚Äôt even have to think about it.

When I explained how my brain works to someone they expressed concern because as a result, I never think of, in the moment, how my current actions would affect someone else or how it would make them feel when making that decision. However, if a person wants to be treated in a certain way, they simply have to tell me it what they want or need so that I can adjust my ‚Äúrules‚Äù and decision making ahead of time. 

So, to recap, Im wondering if how I think and process information is:

MBTI enthusiasts who understand functions are just as bad as the ones who only know 16p,thespideryousquished,1657656899,"It seems like there are only two options: painfully uneducated INFJ-T who only knows the letters, or  hardcore-Jungian gatekeeper who screams 'KNOW YOUR COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS'

Both sides are lacking. The cognitive functions are a helpful indicator of your type, but the strict IEIE format (or strict any format, actually) with the axis pairs just doesn't work. People's cognitive function stacks very, very rarely match up exactly with what they're supposed to. My friend was typed ISTJ and INFP, and after asking her some questions, her function stack is Fi Si Te Ne. Right in the middle of ISTJ and INFP. But there's no correlated type for that. So which is she? I say shes both. She says shes both. A million of you would say ""SHE CANT BE BOTH""

You may say, 'but you cant have that stack because \[insert any reason whatsoever\]'. But she does. people are real. MBTI is a theoretical system that is supposed to *describe* what is real. If the system and reality dont match up, which do you think were supposed to try and change?

Its not just that one friend. I know people who are Fe Ne Se Ti, or Ne/Se Fi Ti, or any number of combinations. There's no good reason for why these combinations dont work other than that the system says they shouldnt

MBTI is useful only when as used for growth or understanding others. If you can look at a person, and see ""ok they use Se in this situation, and react like they use Ti in that situation"", then how can that be bad? Even if the function stacks are a little messed up. **The only** ***wrong*** **way to use MBTI is by using it to put people in boxes that limit them rather than liberate them, and then say they have to stay there, because the widely accepted** ***theory*** **says so.** Which people on BOTH extremes are guilty of doing. There is no harm in someone saying they switch types, or they use different functions in different situations, or have a weird function stack, as long as its *true*, and doing so helps them better themselves and others. So if you're the type of person who gets pissy when someone has a unique understanding of MBTI, specific to THEM, then shut your facehole and leave them alone :)",mbti
"All right, I'm sure I know my real type now.",FarGrape1953,1657656534,"So after hanging around here the past week, and disregarding most of my test results, I read up on the cognitive functions all week. I kept typing as INTJ, but I became sure that I use Si, so that was out. I knew I used Te and Si, but I'm most definitely not extroverted.

I took mistype investigator again today, and it gave, in order: Si (62.31), Te (56.81), Fi (54.69), and Ni (51.38). Top result: ISTJ, second result, ESTJ. Pretty straight forward.

Michael Caloz's test WAS right when I took it originally. ISTJ 84 points. ESTJ 76.

I tested INTJ and INFJ so many times, but no, this has to be it. ISTJ is correct. I use Si. I know I do.

And for those who want to say S types don't plan, or aren't creative, I'll fight that! I'm a college professor. I'm a paid, professional theatre actor.

external similarities between types ( ESTJ Example),whirlwind-fairy,1657639036,"I noticed some external simialrities between types that share simular letter codes.

I dont normally focus on dichotomous apscts of MBTI but I noticed that if somone doesnt pay attention the types that are one letter off can seem simialr under certain circumstances.

An example I will use is ESTJ

In a social and free flowing settings ESTJs can somtiems have a similar attitudes and outward behaviors as ESTPs, even though ESTJs are more idealistic to how they belive and want things to be.

In more strict situations that require focus for the ESTJ, they can share behaviors that may look ENTJ like, even though their reaosnings are entirely different in focus.

In quiet one on one settings ESTJs can seem more simple ISTJs, being more playfully and creative ( as ISTJs are adorable and awkward when they are being playful) but also be more by the book in their thinking.

In a more people focused setting or one where they want to help or gain favor they may take on a more ESFJ like tendecy to mirror people pleasing and supportive roles.

Now I am not saying ESTJs fake these behaviors, but they are more so natural tendencies that similar types can share, and this pattern can be seen in other types that have a common output.

ESTJ - ESTP represents ESTJs fun loving and energetic side

ESTJ - ENTJ represents ESTJs firm and seeking whats best side

ESTJ - ISTJ represnts ESTJs desire to be correct to what is known

ESTJ - ESFJ represents ESTJs desire to help people and make them better.

That has been the same with about most of the types, though I must say I'm not social enough to have conversed with all types of all mental health stages: and some compatible have been out of reach in other ways.

So... Fellow lead Nis: if you have a s/o that likes to listen to you talk as much as you like to listen to them, what is their type and how is it going?",mbti

"PSA: if you want typology to be objective, this is how it's done",Sazzzzzzzzz,1657635622,"Typology today is in a stage equivalent to the earliest (i mean the very beginning) stage of the creation of math

While math is objective today (the amount '1' for me is the same as it is for you and everyone else, and we can all see when there is '1' of something very easily) it probably started out extremely subjective. Developing the number system would've gone through the stages of; 

1) creating a word, 'one', and an accompanying symbol '1'  

2) associating the word with something we can perceive: 1 dog

3) creating a pattern (a set of data): 1 dog, 1 cat, 1 chair, 1 face

4) finding what is common / shared between each individual item in the pattern and extracting the meaning (the commonality is they are all ""1"" of something. You now know what '1' means

5) doing the same thing again, but for all the other numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Eventually, you reach the point where the meaning of each number is the same for you as it is for me

Now here's the thing. No matter what form the amount ""1"" comes in, whether it comes in dogs, cats, chairs, or faces, we can **always** tell that it is still ""1""

Typology is part of the way there, but it's still got a long way to go

Typology has the words: Introverted Thinking  / (one)

It has the symbol: Ti / (1)

You can find people to make the pattern: James, Tim, Erin, Bethany

What is common between James, Tim, Erin and Bethany? 

James is black, Tim is white, Erin and Bethany are females, the other two are males, they all have different heights, different accents, different clothing, different jobs, different habits, different tastes, different sexual preferences

So what's common in all of them? This thing called ""Ti"" is common in all of them. What's Ti? A cognitive function, how do we identify a cognitive function?

The only way is to fkn scan their brains and see if the same brain regions activate the same way as each other. THEN we can say there's some objectivity to it

Dave and Shan from OPS claim they have an objective system, but here's where they're wrong: they think because they agree on what type someone is, after looking at the same footage of a person, but not talking to each other about it, that their system is objective

Nope

Give them each different footage of the same person, and make the person behave randomly in each video, and then see if Dave and Shan get the same answer as each other

My bet is they will get different answers. But if they did get the same answer, THEN they'd be on to something, and it would probably be an objective system

We as humans don't have extra-sensory perception where we can see people's brain regions light up. We rely on technology for that. That's what makes creating a typology system way harder than creating the number system, and why typology is still subjective today",mbti

What job do you think I‚Äôll end up in,chrissycunningham14,1657605858,"I have a job internship for the first time in my life, at a sailing camp in my city. I actually like it so far, largely bc it‚Äôs actually more or less outdoors (even though obviously it can be easy to get dehydrated.) I know we definitely don‚Äôt get sunshine year round, but for me personally it can really boost my mood :) 

I help out w small tasks and today helped lead the kids, sort of, just on walks (which I actually liked even though I felt one or two probably didn‚Äôt like me lol, I j kinda wanna be a mom one day I think.) I found that writing an email was harder than I expected only due to the specific criteria my manager wanted at times. I like waking up for it now even though I hate getting up early partly bc it doesn‚Äôt feel terribly ‚Äúhard‚Äù (I feel I can handle a challenge but) and my supervisor seems nice enough (fake but nice.)

I‚Äôve hung out w 2 ppl in the past week at the park‚Ä¶ and smthn I was reflecting on today, whilst also reflecting on how happy I am in spite of how much my brother has changed due to the drugs that he seems to be getting help now‚Ä¶ is that part of the reason as to why I‚Äôm so depressed year round is due to lack of healthy socialization and also that I feel like I have never just fully prioritized ‚Äúenjoying‚Äù myself.

I tend to be more depressed during winter, I think. Summer, particularly this yr, is when I feel happiest 

Like I feel like I know how to follow tasks and I‚Äôm technically introverted and am generally good abt being consistent, but I feel like I spent so many yrs worried abt college (j to choose to start at community) when I should have been enjoying my youth, trying to make friends (but then I remembered that sometimes in the past it j hasn‚Äôt been that easy‚Ä¶ even as recently as this yr. I don‚Äôt have ‚Äúgood social skills‚Äù but tbh some ppl j don‚Äôt act like they are interested in friendship) 

I find the subject matter of nursing interesting, I know I rlly want to help people. It would honestly probably be unhealthy for me to have a job where I couldn‚Äôt rlly socialize at all. I also find psychology and mental health interesting 

I‚Äôm not the ‚Äúassertive‚Äù type but do value having a work ethic and like to be consistent abt my work 

I deal w depression but am working on getting better abt managing it. I don‚Äôt think I do great w big changes (I can handle it but change tends to sort of stress me out, not entirely but it can.)  

I can have trouble w ppl not liking me and wanting the validation or approval of others. I‚Äôm j being honest here.

My enneagram is 6w5. My family has been having financial problems more recently (my mom refuses to get the vaccine mandate and therefore quit her job as a social worker. She has been working online and crying abt it bc the computer keeps shutting down in the middle of it‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs an ESFJ.) 

I feel like I am relatively self aware in general, I feel like crying almost daily due to my brother‚Äôs predicament (I‚Äôve j realized how depressed he must have been growing up, he‚Äôs in rehab) - I have j noticed how generational trauma has really negatively impacted my family.

I‚Äôm also noticing how much I tend to focus on validation from others, to a point where I‚Äôve cried even recently abt ppl unfollowing or blocking me on Instagram (but I‚Äôve been realizing that it rlly doesn‚Äôt matter that much, actually‚Ä¶ at all. That I‚Äôm young and nothing I tend to worry abt will matter when I‚Äôm an adult. I‚Äôm starting to regret having spent so many years depressed and stressed out.)

advice for INTJs :from an ENTP raised by an INTJ,where-serotonin,1657575341,"

So firstly yeah sorry folks you can plan everything down to the tiny details and still end up creating one of us :) you're welcome and my condolences.So can honestly say being raised by an INTJ as an ENTP has been one of the biggest blessing however much like anything it comes with it pros and cons. 

So I'm 30 my INTJ mum is 50 and here's some things we've learnt .

1. A lot of you have been through a lot of shit and your resilience and determination to move forward is honestly admireable, however not saying Jack shit to your kids about it doesn't protect them from it,it doesn't make you weak you got through your shit how are you ever going to expect your child to be honest with their shit to you if you can't to them.

2. You're old headed, but just because you're old headed doesnt mean life sorted ready for adulthood and all it's responsibilities at 14 you daft twats.


3. You guys are some of the most loyal bastards on the planet and would go to the ends of the earth to help the ones you care about, so don't make it weird when people do the same for you.


4. One of the best things about having an INTJ parent is pride and ego never getting in the way of learning and progressing and anything and everything being up for discussion in a healthy manner. This is what makes you great people and amazing parents, however sometimes your child is just being a prick and deserves the shit they got.


5. You guys care a lot, you show it in acts of service and advice and yes it's undervalued and under appreciated, so stop letting it be by acting like it's no big deal when you don't get Jack shit back.


6. Planning is good, however you can't plan for every thing there's going to be things completely out of your control and you won't know what to do, deal with its okay not to know you can learn.


7. No where near as many people as you think need emotional support, they need a conversation. However stop psyching your self out with your self confidence issues in regards to it because people have berated you and told you you're are the worst person on the planet for it in the past, you're damn good at it and are extremely open minded.


8. Discussing hobbies isn't a crime, no one is going to make it a ""we and us thing"" and take it away from you just by talking about it you wet noodles

"Is this Dominant Si, or Inferior Se?",Esoteric_Innovations,1657574480,"Been considering the possibility that I could be an ISTJ rather than INTJ. Only other possibility is INTP due to well-developed Si, but I'm more skeptical of that because I'm pretty sure I've got Fi rather than Fe.

Possible Dominant Si - I can have very intense, very vivid recollections of past events. Can remember what the air felt like, the expressions on people's faces, exactly what words were said (can relive entire conversations in my head if I focus on them) and  I also like to have a sense of things being comfortable and familiar to me. While stereotypical, I think a good example of this is that I tend to listen to the same music pretty regularly (e.g. I've fallen asleep to the same thing almost every single day for the past month, and will revisit the same songs on a fairly regular basis depending on my mood). Mentally, I also feel pretty stable for the most part in that I'm usually pretty calm and collected - often been called stoic - and only become more engaged in things when I'm interested in them. I'm a very reclusive person, tending not to get out much because I don't have much interest in interacting with other people, but I think of myself as one of the happiest people that I know. 

Possible Inferior Se - I can become easily overwhelmed if there's too much going on at one time. This is best illustrated by the fact that I can think straight if there's a lot of noise and people talking around me all at once. I need to have some peace and quiet to work efficiently. I also tend to be pretty terrible at following routines on a regular basis. I can become easily bored with doing the same things over and over, and need something to be engaged with (albeit this is usually something mentally stimulating instead of physically). Even with the aforementioned music, I only continue to listen to something until I get tired of it, but will usually revolve back to something else I've enjoyed before and have been away from long enough to enjoy anew. This boredom with routine is best illustrated by the fact that I tend to hop from one interest to another every few weeks, never sticking with one for any serious length of time except for two or three core interests of mine (i.e. Political Theory, World History, and Self-Reliance). Though, again - like with music, television shows, films, and so on - I almost always revolve back to things I've already been into before after enough time has passed. 

If it's any help at all, I'm positive that I'm a Self-Preservation 5w4 on the Enneagram after talking things over with people. It makes the most sense based on what I know. On account of my goal in life being to essentially disappear off the face of the earth once I'm financially secure enough to do so, wanting to go somewhere quiet and isolated where I can live out the rest of my days in peace and quiet away from the noise and disorder from the rest of the world. Absolutely free to indulge in my own interests and hobbies without being disturbed.",mbti
"A piece of work for the precious souls having a hard time, just to tell them that they count....",PIYUish,1657573276,"   Too soon, for monsoon


It's too soon for monsoon,
The rain is pouring on everyone,
Making them reminisce every single sorrow,
That's when the pessimistic thoughts arise again.

The rain is graceful,
But the Pain is painful.
It cools down every single area,
Then why do the sorrows evaporate again?

The pain is hurtful, hurtful enough to eat away your soul.
It cannot be seen or felt,
But you know you are suffering from it,
And it gets harder for you and the rest to ease your woes.

Is there any other choice to make you feel better
And to reduce your pain,
Ending the Pain once and for all
Is a new painless cult again.

You Should Be Self-Aware of How Your Dominant Function/Weak Inferior Function Comes Across,MalloyHipHop,1657572791,"I think it's very important, no matter what your type is, to be aware of how your Dominant function and its dynamic with your Inferior function might come across to others.

So like I'm an ENFP, and I'm very aware that sometimes the Ne wild ideas or jumping from topic to topic or whatever can make people overwhelmed or confused, and that sometimes the lack of attention to detail or specifics might be annoying. I don't always use this awareness 100% lmao but sometimes I do, depends on the situation.

But I find that a lot of types with dominant T simply just don't realize if they're being insensitive, too pushy, too technical and annoying others with that, etc.

I've lately had a lot of arguments with Ti types, and some of them just don't realize how the constant technicality and need for exact accuracy of every statement can be annoying.

They have said things like ""As a Ti type, I'm always interested in precise wording, definitions"" etc etc, and that's cool....but can you not see at all how that may be irritating to some (a lot) of people lol?

Not hatin' on them specifically, just thought it was a good example to point out what I'm talking about.

Who do you think I‚Äôll be w longterm based on how I describe him,eddiemunsonlive12,1657558975,"I‚Äôm an ISFJ, he‚Äôs my ex. I first came to know of him because he was dating this girl who has a lot of problems (bipolar disorder, was below average facially to me, seemed a bit ‚Äúoff‚Äù based strictly on vibes when I met her and like she could be somewhat toxic) - he had a crush on her for years, there are 3 votes ESFP for her on this sub and 2 votes ISTP. I remember I was surprised to learn she had a boyfriend at all, as even though her body is conventionally attractive (which he pointed out at one point) I j rlly didn‚Äôt see it for her. But he had her as his profile pic when they were dating. 

I was also surprised bc she had a non-feminine sort of energy to me personally or j didn‚Äôt seem like the sort of girl who would be crushed on? But he‚Äôs bisexual so (said he was only out to his mom.) 

He has an IEP and was taking pre algebra as a junior which I had never heard of before I started dating him. I remember first time we went out, he suggested he wants to be famous and didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd go to college. He‚Äôs black our city is non black 

I assumed that the relationship was going great‚Ä¶ and I was wrong. In September 2021, he posted to his story (I followed him and he already followed me, I had texted his account to get her number) about feeling suicidal and abt how the relationship was over (though he may have posted that to his close friends which he added me to after I sent texts comforting him.) He posted abt how he loved her and I remember he had texted me not long before then asking if I‚Äôd heard from her and mentioning he hadn‚Äôt ‚Äútalked to her in a month.‚Äù He actually asked if I had her address, which surprised me bc I assumed considering they apparently dated for months and he knew her in middle school that he had it‚Ä¶ 

Like I said, he added me to his close friends list and in November actually added me around thanksgiving time to his list of women he was grateful for (on his close friends list.) I had texted him a few times making sure to check in, at some point on a certain day I remember he had texted maybe 3hrs later and asked me why I care abt him so much (I responded, he suggested my response ‚Äútouched his soul.‚Äù) 

we had art together and I checked in on him once, I remember the first time I ever met him (I had made sure to introduce myself to him bc I was curious abt who the girl was dating - I shook his hand and was surprised by how normal he looked, though I remember he struck me at the time as being really unusually quiet. Like he talked real quiet and low to a point where I couldn‚Äôt quite tell what he‚Äôd said, at least at first.) He was also sort of like that the first time we went on a ‚Äúdate.‚Äù I remember he later on mentioned to me that when he‚Äôd first met me he‚Äôd been thrown off or smthn by how erm cheery I seemed, I think? 

But basically in November 2021 - he already had my number bc I‚Äôd given it to him so I could check in and so he could talk to me since he was taking a social media break - he texted me sort of nervously confessing to having romantic feelings for me. I was surprised, he asked how I‚Äôd reacted. I said we could start w hanging out, which is what we ended up doing. I sort of arranged for it, bc he said he had ‚Äúnever been good w social interactions.‚Äù

We hung out the first time, I was extremely surprised by how well it went. I‚Äôm an ISFJ and felt like it was the start of something new. I remember he played a part of his Kanye west album (the one he liked) for me, he pulled down his mask a bit when we were first walking around and I was surprised bc I immediately liked his face just fine. I didn‚Äôt have a good impression at all of how he looked beforehand, j knew that he was overweight (I‚Äôm being honest here.) We walked around and talked a bit, he seemed reflective and not particularly immoral or anything like that. I ended the night telling him I liked him too and he smiled under his mask. At first it was normal and cute

And early on he was good at remembering things about me. .

We did that a couple more times (went on unofficial dates) and were in our talking stage. It was December by this point, by the way. At first it was really new and exciting - there was a bit of an issue along the way bc his ex‚Äôs best friend (who later on set us up but) told him to say we could kiss after I had asked him the day prior so he could ‚Äúconfirm feelings‚Äù (he apparently still had feelings for his ex at the time, which I had not known.) I was angry but he seemed genuinely remorseful over text and like he was really willing to clear things up. I could tell it was genuine. So we talked, I chose to forgive him.

I was still getting annoyed w how long it was taking him to ask me out, and directly mentioned this to him after he suggested he‚Äôd ‚Äúlet me know after break‚Äù on whether or not he‚Äôd ask me out. I texted him annoyed abt it as we‚Äôd already kissed and held hands, he responded and suggested that he had wanted to say yes earlier but felt it to be ‚Äútoo soon.‚Äù After that we started officially going out. He bought me stuff, the relationship started out normal and healthy. 

Of course‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt end up being normal and healthy. It started w little things like him admitting to having a p-rn addiction which I think bothered me (though he seemed to feel really bad abt especially considering what he admitted to watching, like genuinely guilty) more than I let on. 

But it wasn‚Äôt j that, it was also other things - like us never being able to agree on whether or not the school should get involved w his ex and ex‚Äôs best friend threatening to fight me on sight and threatening him too (he actually did seem concerned abt me and nervous about it, yet also seemed to feel his mom had resolved things and that I was overreacting by wanting the school involved - it was an impression, but it caused negative feelings, especially since I knew it was possible we wouldn‚Äôt be together forever.) 

And in hindsight I also now remember that he suggested the school partly shouldn‚Äôt get involved bc he ‚Äúknew people‚Äù and his ex‚Äôs best friend ‚Äúknew people‚Äù and if people knew they would take sides. Which I thought was a horrible concern. But he still suggested I could tell the school if it made me feel safe.

When I remember him, smthn that comes to mind is that he could sometimes like idk‚Ä¶ sometimes come off like he was rational or valued being rational (and later on told me in an argument that I think did lead to our breakup that I was being irrational abt my feeling he didn‚Äôt text me enough when he was busy w house stuff) but other times rlly came off like he had low self esteem (though later on in the relationship, toward the end of it, I felt like he didn‚Äôt come off like that as much) - like he would always shake his head sadly if I said he looked cute. 

And he could sometimes idk erm from my perspective overreact to things a bit? 

What I mean by ‚Äúoverreact‚Äù is that for example when I suggested that him saying he could see how people (like my former best friend and that entire friend group who I had beef with in middle school to a point where I confessed to making accounts where I told them to die but who he never unfollowed) might find me talking loudly in public ‚Äúannoying‚Äù had made me cry or smthn he said when we face timed the next day that he had felt sick or something literally bc of what he said to me due to the extreme guilt or smthn? He sounded like he meant it, too (I‚Äôm remembering that voice lol.) He seemed to feel rlly guilty or at least said he did 

And then when I was considering breaking up, I think due to my sexual boundaries having been disrespecte more than once (I considered breaking up a few times throughout the span of that relationship) he figured it out based on what I said over text and wanted to face time and mentioned he was already having mental health problems and seemed just idk? I remember he mentioned how he‚Äôd ‚Äúnever been good w girls‚Äù and started describing the issues in some of his relationships (all of which were online except for the most recent one w his other ex) and abt how all his exes had dumped him. 

He admitted to me at one point that he was a ‚Äúbad kid‚Äù in freshman yr and used to steal from stores w friends (not a terrible amount but) and was once chased by the police. But looked like he felt bad abt it 

We ultimately ended up breaking up anyway, bc after that argument that I described earlier (the one where he kept saying I wasn‚Äôt being rational) he had us go on a week long break (claimed it works perfectly due to his parents‚Ä¶ but I suspected one of us would lose feelings, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would still love him?) He admitted to me when I came to him in the middle of the week long break that it was bc he felt our relationship had become toxic and pretty much suggested it was bc of me (which is, in hindsight‚Ä¶ not true lmao.) I cried felt rlly bad and promised to work on it ij therapy (I actually did.) 

We got into an argument on FaceTime maybe not long after that as I was making a document of rules for better communication in our relationship and was annoyed w him again bc he was trying to claim that by suggesting our relationship becoming unhealthy wasn‚Äôt one sided I was refusing to take the blame (I ended up pointing out to him that he had rolled his eyes at me after we argued which is a form of passive aggressiveness, he suggested it was not passive aggressive even though it LITERALLY is.) His mom took his phone away bc his leg was already hurting 

He didn‚Äôt directly break up w me but kept extending the week long break (I think his mom wanted us to break up.) When he came back to school we still spent one of the days together of the school week - my behavior had legitimately improved, I was being nicer, but I felt based on body language that he was no longer as into me (I was obviously right.) 

I learned he had blocked me from his story, I texted him abt it we ended up breaking up for good. He suggested we could be friends, I didn‚Äôt want to be. I ended up blocking him entirely and the day afterward went out with my friend (well two days after on a Sunday) and posted ‚Äúain‚Äôt got no time for boys, have plenty of time for friends‚Äù (he saw this a few days later. I know bc his friend unfollowed me and he blocked me from the one account I hadn‚Äôt blocked him from.) 

He also texted me asking for some of the stuff he gave me back - more than once, even though we already arranged a day for it. I did give them back - I wanted to hand them over in a trash bag, but my mom wouldn‚Äôt let me. I threw his stuff down. He obviously noticed as in Art when we were leaving class he pushed past me.

I actually complained on my private spam acc and since he‚Äôs an asshole, he told a teacher and the teacher called his mom. His stupid mother texted me saying she‚Äôd need to get the office involved. I made sure to tell her all about him in response (I was called into the office anyway and told that my venting abt him was ‚Äúdefamation of character.‚Äù I complained, of course, abt his disrespect of my sexual boundaries.) 

He seems like he‚Äôs changed a bit in terms of clothing. He still looks REALLY tired. I don‚Äôt know where he‚Äôll end up career wise.

He was also sort of like that the first time we went on a ‚Äúdate.‚Äù I remember he later on mentioned to me that when he‚Äôd first met me he‚Äôd been thrown off or smthn by how erm cheery I seemed, I think? 

But basically in November 2021 - he already had my number bc I‚Äôd given it to him so I could check in and so he could talk to me since he was taking a social media break - he texted me sort of nervously confessing to having romantic feelings for me. I was surprised, he asked how I‚Äôd reacted. I said we could start w hanging out, which is what we ended up doing. I sort of arranged for it, bc he said he had ‚Äúnever been good w social interactions.‚Äù

We hung out the first time, I was extremely surprised by how well it went. I‚Äôm an ISFJ and felt like it was the start of something new. I remember he played a part of his Kanye west album (the one he liked) for me, he pulled down his mask a bit when we were first walking around and I was surprised bc I immediately liked his face just fine. I didn‚Äôt have a good impression at all of how he looked beforehand, j knew that he was overweight (I‚Äôm being honest here.) We walked around and talked a bit, he seemed reflective and not particularly immoral or anything like that. I ended the night telling him I liked him too and he smiled under his mask. At first it was normal and cute

And early on he was good at remembering things about me. .

We did that a couple more times (went on unofficial dates) and were in our talking stage. It was December by this point, by the way. At first it was really new and exciting - there was a bit of an issue along the way bc his ex‚Äôs best friend (who later on set us up but) told him to say we could kiss after I had asked him the day prior so he could ‚Äúconfirm feelings‚Äù (he apparently still had feelings for his ex at the time, which I had not known.) I was angry but he seemed genuinely remorseful over text and like he was really willing to clear things up. I could tell it was genuine. So we talked, I chose to forgive him.

I was still getting annoyed w how long it was taking him to ask me out, and directly mentioned this to him after he suggested he‚Äôd ‚Äúlet me know after break‚Äù on whether or not he‚Äôd ask me out. I texted him annoyed abt it as we‚Äôd already kissed and held hands, he responded and suggested that he had wanted to say yes earlier but felt it to be ‚Äútoo soon.‚Äù After that we started officially going out. He bought me stuff, the relationship started out normal and healthy. 

Of course‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt end up being normal and healthy. It started w little things like him admitting to having a p-rn addiction which I think bothered me (though he seemed to feel really bad abt especially considering what he admitted to watching, like genuinely guilty) more than I let on. 

But it wasn‚Äôt j that, it was also other things - like us never being able to agree on whether or not the school should get involved w his ex and ex‚Äôs best friend threatening to fight me on sight and threatening him too (he actually did seem concerned abt me and nervous about it, yet also seemed to feel his mom had resolved things and that I was overreacting by wanting the school involved - it was an impression, but it caused negative feelings, especially since I knew it was possible we wouldn‚Äôt be together forever.) 

And in hindsight I also now remember that he suggested the school partly shouldn‚Äôt get involved bc he ‚Äúknew people‚Äù and his ex‚Äôs best friend ‚Äúknew people‚Äù and if people knew they would take sides. Which I thought was a horrible concern. But he still suggested I could tell the school if it made me feel safe.

When I remember him, smthn that comes to mind is that he could sometimes like idk‚Ä¶ sometimes come off like he was rational or valued being rational (and later on told me in an argument that I think did lead to our breakup that I was being irrational abt my feeling he didn‚Äôt text me enough when he was busy w house stuff) but other times rlly came off like he had low self esteem (though later on in the relationship, toward the end of it, I felt like he didn‚Äôt come off like that as much) - like he would always shake his head sadly if I said he looked cute. 

And he could sometimes idk erm from my perspective overreact to things a bit? 

What I mean by ‚Äúoverreact‚Äù is that for example when I suggested that him saying he could see how people (like my former best friend and that entire friend group who I had beef with in middle school to a point where I confessed to making accounts where I told them to die but who he never unfollowed) might find me talking loudly in public ‚Äúannoying‚Äù had made me cry or smthn he said when we face timed the next day that he had felt sick or something literally bc of what he said to me due to the extreme guilt or smthn? He sounded like he meant it, too (I‚Äôm remembering that voice lol.) He seemed to feel rlly guilty or at least said he did 

And then when I was considering breaking up, I think due to my sexual boundaries having been disrespecte more than once (I considered breaking up a few times throughout the span of that relationship) he figured it out based on what I said over text and wanted to face time and mentioned he was already having mental health problems and seemed just idk? I remember he mentioned how he‚Äôd ‚Äúnever been good w girls‚Äù and started describing the issues in some of his relationships (all of which were online except for the most recent one w his other ex) and abt how all his exes had dumped him. 

He admitted to me at one point that he was a ‚Äúbad kid‚Äù in freshman yr and used to steal from stores w friends (not a terrible amount but) and was once chased by the police. But looked like he felt bad abt it 

We ultimately ended up breaking up anyway, bc after that argument that I described earlier (the one where he kept saying I wasn‚Äôt being rational) he had us go on a week long break (claimed it works perfectly due to his parents‚Ä¶ but I suspected one of us would lose feelings, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would still love him?) He admitted to me when I came to him in the middle of the week long break that it was bc he felt our relationship had become toxic and pretty much suggested it was bc of me (which is, in hindsight‚Ä¶ not true lmao.) I cried felt rlly bad and promised to work on it ij therapy (I actually did.) 

We got into an argument on FaceTime maybe not long after that as I was making a document of rules for better communication in our relationship and was annoyed w him again bc he was trying to claim that by suggesting our relationship becoming unhealthy wasn‚Äôt one sided I was refusing to take the blame (I ended up pointing out to him that he had rolled his eyes at me after we argued which is a form of passive aggressiveness, he suggested it was not passive aggressive even though it LITERALLY is.) His mom took his phone away bc his leg was already hurting 

He didn‚Äôt directly break up w me but kept extending the week long break (I think his mom wanted us to break up.) When he came back to school we still spent one of the days together of the school week - my behavior had legitimately improved, I was being nicer, but I felt based on body language that he was no longer as into me (I was obviously right.) 

I learned he had blocked me from his story, I texted him abt it we ended up breaking up for good. He suggested we could be friends, I didn‚Äôt want to be. I ended up blocking him entirely and the day afterward went out with my friend (well two days after on a Sunday) and posted ‚Äúain‚Äôt got no time for boys, have plenty of time for friends‚Äù (he saw this a few days later. I know bc his friend unfollowed me and he blocked me from the one account I hadn‚Äôt blocked him from.) 

He also texted me asking for some of the stuff he gave me back - more than once, even though we already arranged a day for it. I did give them back - I wanted to hand them over in a trash bag, but my mom wouldn‚Äôt let me. I threw his stuff down. He obviously noticed as in Art when we were leaving class he pushed past me.

I actually complained on my private spam acc and since he‚Äôs an asshole, he told a teacher and the teacher called his mom. His stupid mother texted me saying she‚Äôd need to get the office involved. I made sure to tell her all about him in response (I was called into the office anyway and told that my venting abt him was ‚Äúdefamation of character.‚Äù I complained, of course, abt his disrespect of my sexual boundaries.) 

He seems like he‚Äôs changed a bit in terms of clothing. He still looks REALLY tired. I don‚Äôt know where he‚Äôll end up career wise.

ENFP - Insecure about being weird.,Nanami1999,1657553744," 

Hello everyone..!First time posting here, just needed your input on something. I generally really like people, i like pretty much everyone even people that not like me back. I have a circle of close friends that love me for who i am and an amazing SO who adores me. The thing is, i have a history of being considered weird by people. It has always been that way and i have been bullied for being ""weird"" in the past but i have embraced it on some level. Some people even compliment me on my weirdness and think it's cool.

Btw what triggered me is a conversation i had with an esfj friend of mine. She had always been in my friend circle but she was somehow judgemental of me, until we both grew and managed to connect. She used to deem me as too random i used to deem her too uptight. We were both wrong and now we are having fun and appreciate each other. The thing that hurt me is that today she told me that i'm coming off as really weird to new people and that this can be scary for them. She also added that her boyfriend didn't like me at first and still just considers me weird and that he still doesn't really like me. He is a sensor too like her, and the funny thing is that he is doing really good with my intj bf while one the same time my intj bf really likes him but not his girlfriend (my esfj friend) because he thinks that she is really boring and cringey.

My friend and i were discussing this slightly funny situation and she wasn't try to insult me so i laughed it off, but it somehow hurt me. It's not her or her boyfriend's fault but i just feel insecure for being considered ""too weird"" or ""extra"". Usually we are hanging out with our common close friends and i can see him cringing while everyone else is actually enjoying my company. We all get along but i feel a bit awkward and i cannot really avoid him because we are all in the same group.

For example, the other day we were celebrating my bff's birthday and me and my bf were hosting the gathering in our house. I wore a tank top and red lipstick with a frilly skirt and while i was dressing up i remember thinking to myself ""ok X will judge me for dressing slutty but he won't tell anyone"". The other 2 girls were dressed more conservatively and i felt a bit awkward about dressing up. Then we were eating the birthday cake that i made and everyone was wearing one party hat. I felt like wearing 2 and he said something like ""this is what i call being extra"" jokingly. Every time i make a sex joke or a slightly crude joke i can feel him cringing, but when my enfp male bff makes such jokes he is always laughing (that's connected to why i second guessed my outfit). I always felt something was off but know that i connect the dots i feel slighlty sad, because he really likes everyone else and everyone else likes him and i feel left out.

I repeat it's not his fault but it just triggered my insecurity and i felt like sharing.",mbti

&amp;#x200B;

From what I've seen so far, these are the ones that apply to me (over their counterpart) in no particular order:

&amp;#x200B;

**Se**\&gt;Si, **Ni**\&gt;Ne, **Te**\&gt;Ti, (I think), and I am unsure about Fe/Fi.

&amp;#x200B;

How does Fe/Fi even work? I cannot distinguish between them or how they operate despite having read multiple descriptions. Not that this means my Fe/Fi is definitely inferior, because I think(?) I am in touch with my feelings and emotions, although I don't actively think about them often.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, how would I know where these placements stand? Yes my Se&gt;Si, but is that my dom? Aux? What is it?

&amp;#x200B;

Please help! Feel free to ask any questions that can contribute to a conclusion, I will give extensive answers if needed!

question about ENFP's Ne-Te loop,Deep-Charge-943,1657529941,"I know that loops are a very controversial thing and most likely do not exist, but I still want to ask this out of interest. I'll tell right away English is not my native language and I use an online translator. So there may be a crooked translation (although I'm double-checking) :/

I came across this article and saw this: ""**When the Ne-Te loop occurs in ENFPs they become very focused on analyzing the possibilities and trying to use facts to figure out the answers. This is something which can go in a rather vicious cycle, with the ENFP never truly feeling satisfied. They start by analyzing the information and potential, and using data as a means of coming up with a solution or likely outcome. The trouble is that once the ENFP does come up with this answer, their Ne comes back into play and finds even more scenarios and ways this could go wrong or be incorrect. The ENFP continues to go in a loop until they find themselves stressed and constantly unsure of their actions of choices. They need to analyze the information and run it through over and over again, in hopes of figuring out what the best possible choice is, or answer.**""

I have questions about this Ne-Te loop description:

1. Is this exactly the description of the Ne-Te loop? It's just that on other sites the description of the Ne-Te loop is different from this one (here it's about endless analysis and uncertainty in the answer, and on others it's about constantly adding and solving the to-do list without understanding whether like it or not)

2. Isn't this a trait of many INxP with a constant identity crisis? Because it describes them exactly

Bonus. It's not from this site, but from the forum, but it fits the description of this article (it talks about cheating wife and ENFP's reaction to it in the Ne-Te loop): ""**Like when he believed his wife was cheating, Ne would generate a million and one possibilities and ideas about everything his wife said or did. Te would make it concrete because it fit into the construct of a cheating wife. He never double checked his Fi to see if he really felt his devoted wife would do that to him**"".

Do you think that someone has likely had a crush on me before,eddiemunsonlive12,1657511800,"I‚Äôm an ISFJ enneagram 6 (most likely 6w5, I guess.) I‚Äôm black and have grown up in a primarily white and Asian city which I am aware limits my dating options, especially since there are some who would likely find me below average facially (4/10) even though some have found me average as well (I don‚Äôt wear makeup, but will likely start to at some point in my life.) I am skinny, which I am aware will provide me w dating options (I also have a big butt, which I only mention since I know *some* guys find this attractive.) 

I struggle w depression and anxiety, and have since I was 9 (my life actually wasn‚Äôt bad to any extent at all back then yet‚Ä¶ but I had an existential life crisis when we were staying in a hotel as I was feeling homesick and realized that one day I‚Äôd have to move out on my own, that everyone around me would die.) I sometimes feel like I‚Äôm getting better at managing it‚Ä¶ but still feel heavy anxiety if someone unfollows me on social media and started crying when 2 ppl in the org that I‚Äôm maybe still in blocked me (one is an adult but it was so out of the blue one of them also j wouldn‚Äôt allow the org acc to follow me.) 

My family doesn‚Äôt have much money, and never has (well when I was in elementary I feel like we were somehow better off, I don‚Äôt know what happened.) We have particularly been having financial problems recently. I personally feel like it‚Äôs v irresponsible to have kids without having any money saved up, at all (my mom always says they didn‚Äôt plan things to be this way but.) 

My mother is male identified and therefore never left my father even though it is clear that he is half of the reason as to why my older brother has a drug addiction (is in rehab) and so many other problems. She wouldn‚Äôt describe herself as male identified‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs what she is. I believe that she partly didn‚Äôt intervene in regards to some of the odd behaviors my brother was displaying (my therapist called CPS once) due to it. 

I think I may be male identified to an extent as well - when I was still w my ex, I feel like. I was more accepting of certain things (him disrespecting my sexual boundaries) due to him being a guy even though I communicated that I was angry and was likely more upset than I was willing to acknowledge. I believe that some part of me believes since my mom is a housewife that a man should make more money than his wife.. not that my father has that attitude‚Ä¶ bc he is a ‚Äúloser‚Äù in society‚Äôs eyes (kind of like my ex, except my ex isn‚Äôt a grown alcoholic man even though it‚Äôs possible - not guaranteed but possible - that my ex will end up making a low amount of money like my father. My dad is a security guard.) 

I don‚Äôt think I would respond well to being asked out, it happens a few months ago (he was white) at school and I wasn‚Äôt sure f he was serious but also wasn‚Äôt crazy attracted to him? I would want to like know the person who asked me out but also know that if I want to date then I need to become a little more open minded 

I don‚Äôt think I technically have ‚Äúgreat‚Äù morals. There have been ppl who perceived me as being rlly nice, but I have privately for some reason. Thought before that whoever idk blocked me or unfollowed me or harmed me could ‚Äúdie‚Äù (a girl who is the ex of my.d boyfriend once said this to me when I suggested someone called me ugly.) I actually made social media accs where I told my former best friend to bc she harmed me. 

I don‚Äôt have ‚Äúgood social skills‚Äù and never have. I understand social norms and know how to be polite but my parents both don‚Äôt have any friends and I‚Äôve been bullied before so it‚Äôs harder for me. I know what‚Äôs rude and what‚Äôs not but spend a lot of time on the phone. I value being polite and being consistent.  I‚Äôve heard that I sound white, but I probably don‚Äôt *really* if that makes sense (I may subconsciously have my voice like that due to who I grew up around.) 

The careers I am considering are nurse and social worker. Registered nurses in my state are paid well (over $100,000 annually, but my state is expensive) and social workers w only their bachelors make what I guess is average income? I lean nursing, but am also trying to remain open minded and acknowledge that my interests will change (I find subject my matter of nursing interesting.) 

I want to move to a state that has a higher black population than mine, my city is only 7% black. I especially intend to do the if I actually do end up having w child down the line.

My ex (ISxP) and I had a fair number of issues even though the relationship started out rather healthy. I seem to remember that he once mentioned I can come off a bit cold (toward him) but in hindsight I can‚Äôt help but wonder if maybe I wasn‚Äôt as attracted to him as I thought I was or didn‚Äôt like him as much as I thought I did and j rlly liked having a guy who was interested in me (he was average looking to me, just overweight and looked more tired than most people. But to me if someone has average features they are basically average.)

What do you think his type is,eddiemunsonlive12,1657501533,"My grandfather was born in 1942. His parenting of my mother and aunt negatively impacted my mother (who is an ESFJ) to such a great extent that my mother still has leftover issues from it today (she can ‚Äúfunction‚Äù but is still definitely not 100% mentally well.) What I mean by ‚Äúparenting‚Äù is that he was physically abusive (my mom described receiving beatings even after having once had a moment where her father was tickling her.) He and my grandmother also just put my mom and her sister out of the house after my mom and her sister called the police on them due to child abuse. I swear that my mom also once mentioned that my grandpa knew her cousin on his side sexually abused her once and failed to do anything (though I remember my mom also mentioned her boyfriends were ‚Äúscared‚Äù of her father or smthn.) He also once slapped my brother when my brother was little for standing in front of the screen when he was watching TV, and then apologized 

He apparently used to beat my mom over bad grades and that sort of thing. My mom mentioned he performed a sort of reverse colorism or I think liked her more since she was darker or smthn (he apparently once directly punched my aunt in the face.) But his approach didn‚Äôt work, bc my mom never finished college, had kids, and I‚Äôm not inclined to say my brother turned out well at all. 

I remember my mom once mentioned having an early memory of him doing drugs in the bathroom in what would have been the 70s (my mom was born in 1972.) 

But when I met him when I was little he more or less seemed p normal to me? It wasn‚Äôt until I started hearing more abt the beatings as I grew older that I think I became a little more like hesitant idk. He could be fairly chatty when he came over, they lost their house (he and my grandma) and he spent yrs trying to argue to get it back in court even though it was obvious to me that they wouldn‚Äôt. 

He was a news reporter, and my mom mentioned he and my grandma had an abnormal dynamic wherein he was the one who would cook for them and stay home w them or whatever while my grandma worked. My mom always felt my grandpa stressed my grandma out too badly in their later years)

He suggested to my mom that if it were him he would have had me put. Out the house after my mom told him. Therapist had cps come over

My great grandpa apparently complained by how my grandpa wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúreal man‚Äù bc he and ppl in his generation didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwork hard.‚Äù  

He ‚Äúknew‚Äù he had cancer for years without seeing a doctor (he didn‚Äôt trust them and neither does my mom.) I seem to remember that when he was finally close to dying he didn‚Äôt rlly want a ton of us coming to see him 

But he still came over to visit from time to time (my mom wouldn‚Äôt let him and my grandma stay w us in part due to fearing my grandpa would argue w the building manager and get us all put out.) He was good at taking care of his health with herbs and that sort of thing. 

He actually once acknowledged in conversation w me that my mother did not ‚Äúturn out well‚Äù or I remember this. I seem to remember him mentioning he messed up a bit w her but he didn‚Äôt necessarily look sad abt it or anything. 

My mom once said the Jim Crow era traumatized him. I also remember her saying that my grandpa‚Äôs mom was colorist and favored his lighter siblings over him. 

He intended for years to help me write a book that my young self never actually intended on finishing. He seemed intelligent and sounded intelligent but still essentially ended up in a bad position in life (well actually during his last‚Ä¶ months? Yr? Of life he no longer had to go from hotel to hotel as apparently they had stuff lined up for veterans.) 

This might sound weird but I swear I remember once slightly getting the impression that he ‚Äúchecked me out‚Äù (he didn‚Äôt say anything it was j like an impression) but then again I might be wrong abt that?

"More in the post but in general - INFPs, how do I get you to talk to me?",kb_bbingbong,1657497430,"There‚Äôs a bit of grief I need to air out when it comes to an INFP friend so I apologize in advance to INFPs reading if I come off as rude, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre not all like this but I feel like it‚Äôs a tendency that many INFPs may have so I am mainly asking you guys for input, though I would definitely appreciate input from anyone. 

Basically I‚Äôve begun to harbor someone resentment towards this friend not because of anything ‚Äúbad‚Äù in particular they‚Äôve done, but just something about their general way of being that I think is kind of unfair. To be specific, this friend refuses to have any kind of ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù conversations with me (political, philosophical, just opinionated in general like about TV shows) because they‚Äôre afraid ‚Äúthey‚Äôre gonna hate me‚Äù. First of all that irks me because that implying they already think I disagree with them, even though they‚Äôve barely given me a chance to ever explain myself or even prove that I DO agree with a lot of what they say. 

Secondly it‚Äôs completely unfair because they talk about their opinions all the time and if I disagree or think of it differently then I‚Äôm a ‚Äúbad person‚Äù. This is a little hard to explain but they always act, often excessively, like they‚Äôre a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù and like they‚Äôre more ‚Äúmoral‚Äù than other people or something. I think for this reason they are always open about their own opinions and expect me to agree if they say anything. It‚Äôs like they offer an opinion, but not the option to question it or think about it, it‚Äôs just ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù if that makes sense. And I understand it might seem like I just don‚Äôt understand 1+1=2 to people reading this post, but they do this about topics that are hotly debated like there‚Äôs an ‚Äúobvious‚Äù answer. For example, when talking about a political topic they will just say what they think about it and present an ‚Äúindisputable‚Äù piece of evidence and won‚Äôt even listen to an alternate opinion or why people might think another way even when I agree with her just so she can understand why people might think another way and that they‚Äôre not just horrible idiots or something, and she doesn‚Äôt care for it. Which is even more annoying because she‚Äôs always talking about empathy. And before anyone gets on my back for complaining about people who care about empathy I just want to make it clear I don‚Äôt have my head stuck up 4chan‚Äôs butt or anything like that, it‚Äôs just genuinely frustrating how she seems to think only some people deserve empathy.

Other than that, it‚Äôs really frustrating how ‚Äúuncommunicative‚Äù she is? Like if I say something they disagree with or have a problem with, they will just give a one word answer or ‚Äúdisengage‚Äù. And I can never take it back or defend myself because again, they refuse to have a conversation and I am just stuck with the knowledge that I just permanently damaged my reputation. It‚Äôs like I am walking on eggshells with them and at this point I don‚Äôt even try to have these kinds of conversations with her anymore, while she can just keep freely saying whatever they want. At the same time I have to live with the knowledge that they are ‚Äúdiscussing‚Äù it with someone else because I know for a FACT they have (One time I found out they screenshotted something I sent them and talked about it with another one of her friends). I should have pressed her way harder about it tbh. They have asked me if I have empathy and suggested that I am a psychopath a couple of years ago. And I know that might make it seem like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see it and I‚Äôm the problem‚Äù but I don‚Äôt know how to explain it other than those descriptions are blatantly wrong. I may say say extreme things or play devil‚Äôs advocate, but I always make it clear it‚Äôs just for the sake of being extreme, ironic, or understanding the argument better. 

I want to emphasize that other than this she is very nice and thoughtful and I really enjoy her company. When she‚Äôs doing a lot of these things she does it in a very ‚Äúpassive‚Äù way and non aggressively and I feel like she doesn‚Äôt understand why I have a problem with it, or she does and it might bother her but she cares more about standing by her opinion, which I respect to an extent. Honestly it probably just comes down to not clicking well or something, but I want to hear what anyone else has to say. And please no one just say she‚Äôs an ‚Äúunhealthy INFP‚Äù. Ideally I would like to hear why a person or an INFP might be like this from an INFP‚Äôs point of view, how I should confront this friend if at all, and what ways would improve the relationship.

mbti type,Nanaqa,1657489101,"I‚Äôm sorryyyyyyy  I've asked several times but I think I finally found a way to tell the difference between INTJ and ENTJ ( personally ) , I realized that I had a higher Se ( higher than my Fi ) for exemple i enjoy being at parties but then I get drained , and I just realized that I was living a lot more in the present than before bc of high school stress i planned every move i made but it was for a specific goal , i don't like to do nothing with my days or rest too much I prefer to finish tasks before chilling , but I don't like to try new things if I have a busy schedule because idk if these new activities will be useful to me, so I will feel like I'm wasting my time.

many people will say to know your mbti type you just have to see how you was when you were a child , I don't remember my childhood i don‚Äôt‚Äô know if i‚Äôm stupid ? but yeah i don‚Äôt remember my childhood.


with my family i behave like the ENTJ stereotype because my parents can‚Äôt be bossy and fixe limits with my brothers , they‚Äôre always too kinds and too tired so in it's me who yells at my brothers , remind them of the orders, fixe rules and I'm also a bit intrusive because I think I know what's best for them , when my dad want to be bossy im always behind him , it‚Äôs a little bit like a leader , i always want to lead even if my dad does. 

at school i‚Äôm more like the INTJ stereotype ? , i‚Äôm very quiet when i don‚Äôt know people , i‚Äôm a lot in my mind , always thinking , people drain me , i don‚Äôt really enjoy leading because ( im sorry but ) stupids people annoy me , i‚Äôm not saying that i‚Äôm smart just  i don't like people who don't try hard and just want to have fun , i‚Äôm here to get good marks not to have friends or have fun. ( I'm really intolerable and i hope i‚Äôm going to be more open minded about this ).

i don‚Äôt relate that much to Ni tbh maybe because it‚Äôs a very difficult function ?
 but I only overthink if it‚Äôs useful,  i also create fake scenarios in my head w my crush or over or how I could have reacted to situations during the day to know how to react next time. 


- last summer i didn't leave my house , i‚Äôm not joking in 3 months I went out 7 times to shop or go out to eat w my family , and i was really depressed always making scenarios , always overthinking 

- in high school when i was stressed i was completely disconnected from the reality thinking to a plan or a to do list to be reassure , and when I was tired I was much more impulsive enjoying the present  without thinking about the consequences

In a loop im more in a Ni-Fi loop.

Also , i‚Äôm very ¬´ goal oriented ¬ª i do things to get results , and i‚Äôm not very abstract ? I don't know what that means ¬´ abstract ¬ª , but i need concrete examples in the real world , and i love theory and planning and do to list ( to do list for a short period only but at end i almost  never respect them )

Can you type me?,thefamilyjewels_,1657479438,"I am an 18 year old girl, I have done numerous tests related to the mbti and the result in which I saw myself the most was infp, although I also got: Infj, intj, intp and enfp as results. I would like to start by saying that I am an anxious person and that my anxiety is linked to the fear of the others‚Äô judgment. I also had periods in which I was very obsessive. About two years ago I spent a month in which I thought obsessively about the existence of God. I am not religious but I grew up in a Christian family, as a child I looked at religion with fear and with time I detached myself from it. In the period during which I had this ""obsession"" I defined myself as an agnostic, even though I was closer to atheism. The main question was not whether God existed or not, since I did not believe and still do not believe that he exists, but if my position regarding his existence was really true or just a theory of mine. It is necessary for me to specify that that phase was preceded by an identity crisis that had led me to doubt everything I believed in and therefore to analyze the truthfulness of my values ‚Äã‚Äãand of those opposite to mine and so also of God existence. As for the relationship with the others, I am shy and introverted and therefore I do not have many friends. I want to create deep bonds with others but I‚Äôm also aware that this is really difficult to achieve due to my attitude which sometimes is rude. I admit that I have been explicit and critical while speaking, especially when I was surrounded by unknown people or by my parents. In fact, I have the impression that others, including my parents, try to deny reality and this leads me to be outspoken with them in order to ""throw reality in their face"". But right after this I feel guilty and, if it's my parents, I apologise to them but then I start acting this way again soon after. In the past this sense of guilty had led me to imagine of reaching an unreachable state in which I no longer judged people, since, knowing them all in depth, I was able to understand the reasons behind their actions. When I finished high school and some classmates had read their letters to the class, the only thing I thought about was in fact that I had lost the chance to get to known my schoolmates due to my shyness and attitude. (I am not english so I apologise for any errors).",mbti
What would you say separates an ENTJ from an INTJ?,Esoteric_Innovations,1657476809,"I know for a fact now from discussions with a lot of you that I use Te and Ni in some combination. 

I was thinking that I was an INTJ after a recent talk with people, but I'm honestly not sure. I see both the strong Ni and Te that some of you have seen in me, and I already agreed with the xNTJ typing I'd always gotten on tests ahead of time, but what's eating at me is that I'm pretty sure I have more Te-Se than Ni-Fi despite being more socially introverted. Almost all of my thinking is about planning for things that I need to get done and/or working out what works and what doesn't from systems that I'm interested in (e.g. political theory), and looking forward to the things that I enjoy during my down time, which I'd chalk up to Te and Se respectively. Planning and execution are important to me with pretty much anything, and I get easily frustrated when things don't go as planned or there are particularly difficult obstacles. I go into almost any position hyperfocused on *""What am I doing? What's the plan here?""*

At the same time, I'm not overtly successful. More accurately, I'm not concerned with success beyond being able to be in positions of management where I'm free to make my own rules and guide things in the direction that I think would be for the best for everyone. Or at the least, something I'd love to do is become completely financially independent and possibly start something of my own rather than work for someone else.

I'm not a particularly outgoing person either, being something of a social recluse outside of anything that doesn't involve my family, two close friends, my significant others, and work. It's not uncommon for people to not hear for me for days, if not weeks, because I have a complete absence of interest in most social situations; I feel as though I get nothing out of them. 

So I'm stuck trying to figure out if I'm simply a deeply socially introverted ENTJ, which isn't too uncommon on its own, or just a regular INTJ.

55. ‚ÄúYou have trouble communicating your ideas to people‚Äù (big one for me)

61. ‚ÄúYou are an excellent problem solver and have an incredible ability to analyze things in depth‚Äù (sounds like a mix of Te and Ni to me)

79. ‚ÄúYou have a strong tendency to see things as either good or bad‚Äù

ESTP really refuses to get it and tells ESFJ to get it off his sight.

INTJ says he's allergic to fur.

ISTP tells that the suit does not fit his fursona.

ENTP says he's more of a fox person.

ENTJ started to hold her gun against the consul. ESFJ started running away.

ENFJ says he is not into fursuits.

ISFJ says she prefers only cooling clothes than warm suits.

ISFP says that she already has a fursuit.

INFJ just ran away because he remembered being bullied by a furry because he looked like a bootleg Gandalf.

And pretty much everyone else doesn't want the fursuit.

However, INFP, INTP and ENFP were kind of interested in taking the fursuit. But there are three girls to choose from. ESFJ was thinking who should he give it to?

ENTP..?,knaped_,1657454642,"Hey, for quite some time I have been trying to figure out which type I am. Tests tell me ENTP and so does my girlfriend (and some other types too like INTP or ENFP). 

There's just a few things that I am confused about.

So, let's say I am at work in this cafeteria with my co-workers. And suddenly I want to bake something, without really thinking about it too much and google a recipe for something. The others go ""noooo aaaahhh let's just chill"". I never really check if all of the ingredients we need is there, but I might think about it for a split second as I get all the ingredients out to start. And if there's any ingredient missing, I'll try to use something else instead (which I also google real quick and then just go). But when starting the whole bakerything, I need to follow the recipe step by step, I can't improvise. And when someone tells me a tip on how to do something better; like adding more of a specific ingredient; I will do that forever after that. 

&amp;#x200B;

One more thing related to Fe. I am a people pleaser, right? I don't care what my own judgement of myself is as long as other people like me. I like to feel like I am needed and that I am making a significant difference that improves peoples living, and I want to hear it and get praised. You could say I also like the attention of things. I want that stranger on the street to think I'm awesome. But when it comes to people I strongly dislike; I don't really care. I hate them. rawr. Also, I like to be there for people, not because I value their feelings that much or feel with them, but because I feel good when I feel like I'm needed. I struggle to empathize with people.

When I do something wrong, I get anxious. When people give me (even constructive criticism) I'll start to cry any second. 

This makes me confused because, I don't really care for people if I don't get the confirmation that I am needed, or good. And when I don't get that confirmation, I feel really down and anxious. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing; I don't really know if I like change or not. I need a routine to be energized but I just can't stick with it for more than 2 days. I could have my life completely the same forever but then I would lose energy because of it. I like new things a lot and I strive to do new things because they energize me, and I get bored and unmotivated when things stay the same. But that also drains me and sometimes I just want certain things to stay the same but other things to change. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing; I feel really good when I'm alone but I also get energized when I am around people. I don't really have any troubles with big, loud crowds (except that I get so mad at people STANBDING IN THE GODAMN WAY OF ME THAT I WANT TO BURN THEIR WHOLE GODAMB HOUSE DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). I need my alone time but I also need to meet people to stay motivated for life.

(seroiusly everyone that walks slow and just stands in the middle of a way with their 2x2 twins  should just not exist you make me want to but your kids in a microwave i hate you so much xoxo kisses mwah hugs xx)

&amp;#x200B;

Annnnd the last thing; I think about past tense a lot. I have had some trauma in my life and I think about it everyday. Things I do also reminds me of things I used to do, and I like to tell people about it until I end up on a whole different subject, but it only counts for things I experience, not things I see. For example; I watch a sunset and I'm empty, I sit on the beach and I am filled with an endless void of.. empty. But I can walk by a statue and tell my friend ""hey! i licked that boob on the statue once, also it was moved it just to be there and there, hey i want to lick it again lets gooo"". I do also have a lively and very creative mind that likes to make up scenarios of things that could happen right now, or in the future.

Is this Ni or Ne behavior,moonstar2112,1657447829,"This is about me and whether my Intuition is extraverted or Introverted

So I like reading books. I also have been described to have an amazing sense of humor, often finding various rhymes with words and cracking up everyone around me. The first being common Ni behavior but the latter being Ne. I have a tendency to do weird things to the world around me. Once I got in trouble for writing a fantasy novel on a school exam paper. When I'm not doing weird stuff I am in my head thinking about who came up with the concept of time and somehow ending up at the subject of reptile biology three hours later. 

As far as I can tell I have both behaviors of Ni and Ne users. I just don't know which is stronger. I think if I have Ne I might be ENFP because I suck at math, but if I have Ni I might be INFJ for the same reason I stated earlier. 

A few more of my traits are that I like not just reading books, but I also love writing my own. Specifically Fantasy novels. My mother says I talk too much and  that I need to stop 'talking back' to her. I got INTP on multiple tests and INFJ on multiple tests as well. People who got assigned with me on a group project have complimented me on my so-called 'awesome ideas' but criticized me for being a scatterbrained loser as well.

What type do you think I seem realistically likely to end up with?,eddiemunsonlive12,1657418048,"I am an ISFJ, as my user flair states (and am an enneagram 6, like a lot of ppl - I read once that 6w7 and 9w1 are most common which makes sense to me.) 

Yesterday was another big day for me in regards to change (I am not generally a fan of big changes) - the one org member who had advised I stay in the youth activist org blocked me a few days ago‚Ä¶ but yesterday one of the guys who was my co President wouldn‚Äôt let the org acc follow me, like j literally wouldn‚Äôt and then he unfollowed me right after. And then actually ended up blocking me. All I‚Äôve ever done is complain abt how we had huge, serious org drama in the past‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs hypocritical 

But idk, I‚Äôve been blocked by 5 ppl at this point in general and yesterday after a ton of crying I decided that for the sake of my mental health I will indeed be quitting this org. I was reflecting on how whilst in middle school I rlly wanted to be popular, I have never been the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù type at all. 

It was one of those days where it REALLY hit me that no one in this world cares abt you‚Ä¶ especially when you‚Äôre black. I don‚Äôt have good social skills and have never been the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù type at all. I don‚Äôt know why I was blocked since no one communicated. I do know that today, I started to feel better about it, bc it‚Äôs sunny outside and I‚Äôm thinking of taking a permanent social media break, of maybe even deleting it. People that want to talk to me will get my number. I have plans tmr. 

I do know that ppl unfollowing or blocking me on Instagram lately has been giving me rlly bad anxiety. I feel like I should have my friends by now, but I don‚Äôt. And yesterday it was rlly hitting me how fake most people are. I was also feeling a lot of guilt, even tho I don‚Äôt think I was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù to complain. It was j rlly hitting me hard, I cried and it was worsening my depression.

In terms of values, I personally care abt trying to be polite. As for whether or not I truly have good morals‚Ä¶ I used to sort of think I did, but I‚Äôm not so sure anymore. I mean, I made social media accs where I told my former best friend and her new best friend to die like 2yrs ago (well in sophomore yr) along w this other girl who I actually still talk to now/am friends w again, bc what they did or said REALLY hurt me. 

To me that‚Äôs maybe a sign that I don‚Äôt have good moral character, but I also can‚Äôt say many ppl I‚Äôve met have had good morals in my opinion either. I don‚Äôt think I lack empathy for others. I don‚Äôt mind buying things for someone and sometimes even want to care for or nurture somebody, especially if they‚Äôre a small child (ppl on r/findapath guessed that I will become a ‚Äúnurse and then stay at home mom‚Äù - my mama is a housewife.) 

I remember kissing my ex boyfriend (who was a ISxP, terrible relationship in the end) rlly hard after he admitted that he used to be a ‚Äúbad kid‚Äù and steal from stores in freshman yr. He was actually a bit terrible. He has an IEP and idk I no longer think he‚Äôs a good person since he disrespected my sexual boundaries (but I stayed w him in spite of communicating my anger and gradually growing more and more angry.) I guess you could argue that in that instance I dated down in terms of education level‚Ä¶ sort of (since we‚Äôre rising seniors.) 

I guess you could also argue that I‚Äôm sort of male identified, sort of. I‚Äôm probably less stressed now that my ex and I are done, but I j want to get asked out again and have my super fun high school romance (I write fanfics if you can‚Äôt tell.) But I‚Äôm black and am slightly below average facially (now‚Ä¶ makeup may help) and have grown up in a primarily white and Asian city, so. Even though I fully intend to eventually move, my chances of having a super fun awing romance are p slim. I was also able to acknowledge yesterday that my self esteem must be in a better spot first. 

My mother is also male identified. She has stayed w my father even though he emotionally abused my brother and was apparently unemployed when they first met (she‚Äôs likely ESFJ.) Our family is having financial issues right now? Which I think is worsening my depression (kind of? I feel rlly good on some days) bc most ppl in my city can‚Äôt relate to that. 

She was also v lenient abt my older brothers behavior when he was on drugs and didn‚Äôt send him to rehab or even a mental hospital until it was too late, even though it was probably realistically harmful toward me (well, I know it was. But I still have grown to feel bad for him in the past few yrs anyway and can‚Äôt help but think about how lonely he must have felt during his childhood and have occasionally understood particularly yesterday why he was depressed and why he took drugs and even was screaming at myself in the mirror - mentally - abt how while I will never actually do drugs, I could still see why ppl feel like they need a ‚Äúfix‚Äù when life is this hard. But I‚Äôll never actually do them.)

For example, I may plan a short story by knowing what key events need to occur for my theme to be conveyed and leave figuring out how these events come to be for later.

Am I an INTP or ENTP?,mxyxh,1657412420,"Recently, I‚Äôve been looking into cognitive functions to try to figure out which fits me best. Before this,  i still believed I was either an INTP or ENTP, as I was pretty sure was an XNXP. I relate to many different aspects of both INTP and ENTP, my main issue is trying to figure out which one I favor or find myself doing most. Also, I'm not sure if it'll help but I am a teenager.

Reasons why I think I might be an INTP:I enjoy social situations and am very talkative, but I tend to get drained easily and only enjoy it if I‚Äôm around close friends or people I know well. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of large parties or family gatherings(although that may be because I‚Äôm not close with  many relatives and cousins). I have good social skills, but after using them for a few hours I feel drained and have to take time for myself. I‚Äôm not the best at reading how other people think. I worry about misinterpreting signals and feel like a fish out of water when talking to someone I don‚Äôt know much about. I tend to overthink small details and it takes time for me to get used to socializing with people I don‚Äôt know. When I was very young, around 5 or 6, I think I struggled with no necessarily social cues, but I struggled with starting conversations and was pretty awkward In classes without close friends or people I know, I struggled to make friends and connections and was pretty closed off. I struggle to be in public, specifically in stores and I feel awkward and don't know what to do at all. Also, many of the struggles I've had recently are identifying my own emotions and figuring out how I feel about certain things. Sometimes I also don't know how to express them and I either don't have as much of an emotional response or have a huge reaction after it. Many times, I'd know I felt a certain way but I wouldn't be able to describe it or explain why. Before saying anything in serious situations(for example, I recently broke up with someone), I would take a moment or sometimes even a few minutes to deduct what the best response would be. When I'm under stress, I feel like I fit INTP better. I tend to obsess over proving other people wrong, and tend to nitpick others opinions. I struggle with making choices with no clear logical answer,

Reasons why I think I might be an ENTP:One reason why I think it‚Äôs unlikely for Fe to be my last function is because for most of my life, it has always been relatively well developed. I found and still find it easy to step into someone else‚Äôs shoes, and I used to be the  ‚Äùtherapist friend,‚Äù although now I‚Äôm able to set boundaries and put myself first. However, usually when people were talking about their worries, I would provide possible solutions after awkwardly comforting them a bit, so I guess I was helping them more with making logical decisions and figuring out what they should do next. I mentioned this previously but I am quick to make friends once I feel I can trust them and I know about them enough. The main reason reason why I'm conflicted with this the most is because as a kid, I was always outgoing and liked to make friends. Although I did have many friends or acquaintances, I always stuck with a set of close friends I knew I could trust and depend on and usually had one close friend that I'd tell everything to. I‚Äôve always considered emotions as an important part of us, and something that still should be considered along with logic to make good decisions and when I was younger I‚Äòd make decisions on how my actions would make others feel rather than which was the most logical conclusion.I also relate to ENTPs as when i‚Äôm thinking or trying to sort through ideas, I usually call a friend and bounce off ideas with them to help further my understanding of things. Although I definitely spend time thinking through serious decisions on my own, having someone else‚Äôs input is reassuring for me as I‚Äòm often worried of making irrational decisions due to past experiences with my impulsivity. It also helps me sort out my emotions as it forces me to really think about why I feel a certain way.

I think I might stop now since this is getting pretty long but one thing I do know is that Si is one of or the weakest functions which is another reason why I‚Äôm leaning towards ENTP. I'm going to attach my results from the sakinorva test and Michael Caloz's test.

I'm sorry if this is a bit of a mess. Some parts may be contradicting or repetitive but I've spent nearly 3 hours typing and looking over this so I think I'm going to just post it as it is.

can anyone type me? (Mbti),Aoc_1,1657412239,"Questions:

What do you like doing with your life?

Eat, Sleep, Observe things only but not 
Ashely trying out things.

 instead sometimes I do it but then I regret it doing Se activites but I don't overthinking about it.

 so instead I observe things and TV watching. 

-and Playing with my phone

So when it comes to going out to get things I don't regret it.
 but when it comes to Se Activites I do (phisically) 
 So instead I think about doing it.

-sometimes I like being out of the house

-sometimes I always tell myself if you feel and think Like your going to regret doing Se activites then dont do it 

I don't always observe things mostly but I would say when it comes to class arguments and chaos and surroundings I don't know the situations I can hear it but I don't listen to it I'm just clueless.

-i also have these problems when I'm paranoid telling my personal life to people on asksadent and how I would make people feel uncomfortable. (technically rn I'm just setting an example of my life in reddit) 


What do you think of the past?

Honestly I feel uncomfortable thinking about it and talking about it because it just seems unimportant to me but I do learn from it and move on.

-or I don't remember the past at all

What do you like doing at home?

Eat, sleep, watching TV, Playing with my Ginniepig, sometimes exercise in my backyard,

- I also stay in bed looking at the wall thinking about Se activites that I'm paranoid doing (in my imagination) because I feel like i might regret it because I might make an unexpected outburst that people will question me.

-i also think it's boring to me to do Se activites

- I also stay in bed imaginating the future for my goals like how I can improve my past self

- sometimes I imaginating the future of my classmates and me  how and what would it be for chaos coming in highschool

How do you interact when you are in Public

- I guess I play with my phone and just observe
-sometimes Se activities that I don't wanna do

-or Idc about it

How do you interact etc when your in school?

-more private to my personal life mostly I be careful spilling my life

-when it comes going to classes I'm usually a quiet person in the back of the class Judging People Silently or don't say anything and don't laugh about it (unless I'm laughing about jokes to myself or close friends)

-when it comes to class jokes, arguments, drama I always don't laugh at them..  because I don't see them funny I'm clueless about it.. because i don't care... Unless it's useful for the future mostly I think about it but not Ashely exposing the person life because it seems awkward to me idk why.

When I'm in class
 When I'm alone Im efficient because I feel like doing it not because I want to I really don't want to I just want freedoom to get away from my classmates and people
And go home.

And if I don't feel like doing it I do these things:

-do it but laziness but try to put half of the effort not too much

- do It tomroow

- or not doing it because I feel like I don't need it unless its important for the future to achieve the meaning of things.

-or not do it at all for no any reason

-i get stuff done but not on time

are you introverted or extroverted etc (similar to it) ?

Introverted

Why do you do school work and do you like it?

-i do it because I want to see/know the meaning of things person, place, thing and translate it to my own words so I can understand it myself and for the future because maybe I want to have interest into things what I learned in school.

- I also do it because not because it's my duty to do it.
I want to know the meaning of things instead of Ashley knowing the word and not explaining it what it is.

-And no I dislike school work

What do you do in the weekends?

Eat, sleep, go outside and play music to observe and think of the future or things that aren't real, Stay in bed and planning the future of disasters that probably might happen instead of thinking of the past much. 

How can you describe yourself in your opinion?

an Emotioness person Who doesn't care about school drama etc but just wants freedoom to get out of a place full of loud people of idiots thinking they are from a zoo and I just wanna be alone time. 

Just a person who is a narrator of a story,
I see my entire life as a story for every new beginning in the future.

I can see (and sometimes feel mostly Se) myself waiting for a new beginning in the Future.

What do you want in the future?

-understanding the meaning of things

-trying to figure out what I really want to do when I grow up because almost everything seems boring to me.. and it doesn't feel like me that I'm interested in

-giving people like showing an example of my way how I do things
Like giving people a good experience of my opinion think of it like enetertaining people of my project.
To see others feedback what they suggest so I can improve myself.

I also forgot to mention I don't even remember the past much...

Do you like being controling to others?

-no unless it's necessary

-but I also don't control people I like people being themselves 

-im not an Entj or an Estj controlling people with efficiency (or something similar like that)

Do you hate people?

hate is a strong word to a person so I used dislike but only if there Sensers that are stupid who likes following the rules etc.

What do you do in a group projects?

-do the work in my way and share it with peoples opinions to help the project  so I can find a way to see meanings of things what they say and mean.

- or let the sensors be dumb in a school project (not all sensors are dumb btw I meant like the sensors in my class can be anoyying)
(I only do this when it's not a project that is important to me in my opinion) 

- I don't always do the work all the time though
 (unless it's not a school project I get things done but not on time) 


Any Questions of your feedback I would like to hear more of your opinions.


So in Conclusion I think I'm an intp in my opinion

But I don't act (and  communicate ) like one really because it isn't me because I don't feel comfortable talking about the past and making things out of logic of ideas and memes.

(Not all intps do this right?)

So I would take I act half of an intj and an intp  but I'm an intp


The congintive functions are right but I don't feel like I relate to an intp much when it comes to random logic and ideas and memes from the Internet.

But I think I'm a mature like an intj I literally don't laugh at jokes at all unless I'm alone or with friends.

But I feel like an intp 

I am not saying when I'm efficient I'm an intj 

And when I'm not I'm an intp

Fe-Ti va. Fi-Te Social Justice,BlessedBeTheFlerm,1657409101,"OK here‚Äôs a theory: I feel like there are two kinds of social justice and the one we typically think of is actually Fe-Ti.

Fe-Ti social justice:
- Loves academic language and labels (Ti specificity)
- Organizes big rallies (Fe community)
- Nitpicky about logical symbolism, e.g. no Handmaidens at women's marches because it is too white (Ti again; the details have to correct, while Fi would appreciate the variety and not care so long as people are putting in work for outcomes)

Fi-Te social justice:
- Dislikes academic jargon (Te practicality likes easy to digest info)
- Values outcomes over community (less rallies, more individual effort)
- Not interested in symbolic consistency, just outcomes and individual intent (Fi individuality)

So even though Fi-doms are stereotyped as the typical social justice person, I think the way the stereotype presents is really more Fe-Ti.

If you are really drawn to a certain type,bunnynak,1657403804,"If you are really really drawn to a specific MBTI types of people, would you say it's because more than likely they are your own type or because they are different from you? My friends aren't exactly who I was really drawn to, but we became friends because I guess we were pretty compatible and feel comfortable around each other. But for romantic purposes, I am really drawn to a specific type of people, and I am wondering if it's because they are actually my type (because we feel naturally drawn to similarities)",mbti

Can you guys guess my type?,Hot-Newspaper-6322,1657402145,"I‚Äòm a bit new when it comes to cognitive functions and would like you guys to guess my type to confirm my suspicions about being a specific type. I chose this subreddit because I know that there are lot of people who know more than I do and probably have more experience than I do. Of course I won‚Äòt just listen to anybody but having an opinion from the outside would be great. I‚Äòm a girl btw.


I personally would say that I‚Äôm an ambivert. In Social group Settings I‚Äôm always included and talkative but I still need alone time to recharge. People describe me as charismatic and willing to help but also spirited. I‚Äôve always attracted people who open up to me and want me to give them advice, be it adults or people my age, people kinda just trust me. When I‚Äòm angry, I‚Äôm often revenge ridden but that just cools down most of the time, unless I‚Äôm really angry and hurt. I‚Äòm not very forgiving and planned revenge on my bully for a long time. He got into a lot of trouble and had to leave the school. I didn‚Äôt feel any empathy for him and didn‚Äôt regret what I‚Äôve done to be honest, even though people told me that I was overreacting. I actually felt satisfied and he told me that he started to respect me because I never stopped trying to take him down. He is stupid. 

In school I‚Äôm bad at subjects that I hate like math related subjects but am very good at subjects that genuinely interest me like philosophy, German and history. 
I‚Äòm the class representative (most of my classmates voted for me) but I honestly wouldn‚Äôt want to be one again. I didn‚Äôt like the responsibility and duties that came with it. Although I must say that I was very passionate about winning the election because I saw it as a competition. Sometimes I accidentally get in positions where I take on leadership but in the end I feel like it drains me out and that I‚Äôm not patient enough, it doesn‚Äôt feel natural to me.
In group projects I‚Äòm the one that needs a bit of a push if the project doesn‚Äôt interests me and is wasting my time but if it‚Äòs something that interests me, I will be thriving.

My hobbies are reading books and drawing. I love reading books about love even though I haven‚Äôt experienced romantic love yet myself and don‚Äôt plan to (don‚Äôt want to get distracted) but reading about it is something I really like. I often don‚Äôt finish books if they get boring and don‚Äôt have a goal on how many books I wanna read. My goal is to read books that I enjoy and that genuinely teach me something for e.g. books about psychology or just romance. 
I‚Äòm very self critical when it comes to my art and often just want it to be perfect which is why I sometimes just stop and then pick it up again after some time but I never give up on it completely. 

I have longterm plans when it comes to my future and I often think about them. I like to imagine how my future life and goals will look like but sometimes I have no clue on how to achieve things and just need a push to actually do things. The ambition is there but I like to let my options lay open and not be set in stone.   

I select my friends carefully and often just know what peoples intentions are and who to befriend. I notice when something is not right but I often just can‚Äôt explain why. This is something that frustrates me when I try to communicate my reasonings to other people. I often don‚Äòt feel understood at all which is why I don‚Äòt trust many people and am just a private person in general. 

My friends would say that I‚Äôm trustworthy but closed off myself. When I‚Äôm with them, I like to joke around and keep the atmosphere light but I don‚Äôt shy away from debating and actually like it.
I don‚Äôt like when people take debates personally and that I don‚Äòt always have the same opinion. My friends and family would also describe me as stubborn and a bit short tempered or impatient. 

I love to analyse things especially people. I love to see their psyche as this one big thing that consists of many little details and was formed by many experiences. Sometimes when I finish a movie and find an interesting character, I will write an essay about them just out of pure curiosity.

My room is organised most of the time and I don‚Äòt like clutter. Sometimes I get called a clean freak but I don‚Äôt I am one. I can just think more straight when my room is tidy. Although when I‚Äòm depressed the opposite happens, so I like to say that my room is often reflecting my mental state (not always). 


I hope that these are enough informations and feel free to ask for more if needed. English is not my mother tongue which is why I excuse any grammar mistakes and would prefer them to be pointed out. Thanks in advance:)",mbti
I have a theory about ENFP‚Äôs being bitches,Mariek_26,1657402002,"As an ENFP myself and since a little soul searching, I found out that I am all nice, sweet and naive and I will even let people walk all over me, UNTIL‚Ä¶ I strongly disagree or really don‚Äôt want to do something or REALLY want to get something done. 

Then I can become a real bitch you should not mess with and people really dislike me when crossing paths with me then. And I mostly scare people off and they call me a bully or bitch. 

And I‚Äôve noticed this a little bit with other ENFPS I know and started to see a pattern with celebrities (as far as I can tell because obviously I don‚Äôt know them personally). For example I know that MIKA (no hate to MIKA, I love him!!) the singer is a true ENFP and my boyfriend (who can read people really well) said that MIKA is probably the nicest person ever, until there is a situation that he doesn‚Äôt like and then he will probably the biggest Diva. Just like I can be a little bitch. 

So what do you think? I hate this part about myself and you? And why do you think this is? TE function maybe?",mbti
